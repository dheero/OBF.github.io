First-ever Published BOSC Proceedings
-------------------------------------

The BOSC Organizing Committee is pleased to announce that this year we
will be publishing the first-ever BOSC Proceedings in the Open Access
journal, [BMC
Bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/).

Who is eligible to submit?
--------------------------

-   Presenters at BOSC 2010 whose abstracts were reviewed and accepted
    before the conference (not Lightning Talk presenters who signed up
    past the abstract deadline or at BOSC itself) are invited to submit
    a 4-5 page manuscript (approximately 2,500 words, not including the
    abstract and references) for publication in the Open Access journal,
    [BMC
    Bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/).

Important Dates
---------------

-   The deadline has been extended to Wednesday, August 18.

How to submit
-------------

-   Manuscripts must conform to BMC Bioinformatics [ author guidelines
    and
    formatting](Media:Instructions_for_authors_-_BMC_-_Appendix_A.pdf "wikilink").
    -   Manuscripts are expected to take up 4-5 printed pages in the
        journal, approximately 2500 words, not including the abstract
        and references.
    -   Manuscripts may be submitted in .pdf, .doc (Microsoft Word
        97-2003), or .rtf format (files can also be zipped, .zip).
        -   TeX/LaTeX - please use BioMed Central's TeX template:
            <http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/ifora/tex> and submit
            your file as a PDF file.
        -   MS Word - A MS Word
            template (http://www.biomedcentral.com/download/templates/BMC154d.dot)
            is available and consists of a standard set of headings that
            make up an article manuscript, along with dummy fragments of
            body text. (Additional instructions are found in the [
            author guidelines and
            formatting](Media:Instructions_for_authors_-_BMC_-_Appendix_A.pdf "wikilink") document.)
-   Manuscripts must be submitted via our [Open Conferences System BOSC
    Proceedings
    site](http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2010-Proceedings/openconf.php),
    ***NOT*** through the BMC Bioinformatics submissions site.
    -   Paste the abstract for your manuscript in the Abstract form
        field (not your abstract from the conference). Your abstract
        should also be included in the main manuscript you upload.

Review Process
--------------

-   Manuscripts will undergo an additional round of peer-review by a
    minimum of two reviewers (abstract acceptance to BOSC does not
    guarantee publication in the Proceedings).
-   In the case of a mixed review, the manuscript will be seen by a
    third reviewer and the Proceedings editor (Kam Dahlquits) will make
    the final determination of acceptance.
-   The decision of the BOSC 2010 Proceedings editor will be final.
-   Once all the decisions (including revisions) are completed, the
    manuscripts will be given as a set to BMC Bioinformatics
    for publication. They will not undergo additional review by BMC,
    although the Editor-in-Chief (BMC-series) reserves the right to
    request changes or reject manuscripts that do not meet the
    Journal standard.
-   Once the article has been typeset by BMC, the authors will be
    notified to check their articles for corrections.
-   Once all of the corrections are in and payment of the Open Access
    page charges (see below) has been made, the articles will
    be published.

Open Access Page Charges
------------------------

-   Authors will be charged the fee of GBP 550 per article, invoiced by
    and paid directly to BioMed Central. This fee is payable regardless
    of any BioMed Central membership arrangements, and it shall be the
    responsibility of the author to pay this sum to BioMed Central for
    inclusion in the Proceedings.
