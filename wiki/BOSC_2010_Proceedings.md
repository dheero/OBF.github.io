First-ever Published BOSC Proceedings
-------------------------------------

The BOSC Organizing Committee is pleased to announce that this year we
will be publishing the first-ever BOSC Proceedings in the Open Access
journal, [BMC
Bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/).

Who is eligible to submit?
--------------------------

-   Presenters at BOSC 2010 whose abstracts were reviewed and accepted
    before the conference (not Lightning Talk presenters who signed up
    past the abstract deadline or at BOSC itself) are invited to submit
    a 4-5 page manuscript (approximately 2,500 words, not

including the abstract and references) for publication in the Open
Access journal, [BMC
Bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/).

Important Dates
---------------

-   Manuscripts are due on August 15, 2010.

How to submit
-------------

-   Manuscripts must conform to BMC Bioinformatics [ author guidelines
    and
    formatting](Media:Instructions_for_authors_-_BMC_-_Appendix_A.pdf "wikilink").
-   Manuscripts must be submitted in PDF format via our Open Conference
    Systems BOSC Proceedings site, ***NOT*** through the BMC
    Bioinformatics submissions site.

Review Process
--------------

-   Manuscripts will undergo an additional round of peer-review by a
    minimum of two reviewers (abstract acceptance to BOSC does not
    guarantee publication in the Proceedings).

Open Access Page Charges
------------------------

-   Authors will be charged the fee of GBP 550 per article, invoiced by
    and paid directly to BioMed Central. This fee is payable regardless
    of any BioMed Central membership arrangements, and it shall be the
    responsibility of the author to pay this sum to BioMed Central for
    inclusion in the Proceedings.
