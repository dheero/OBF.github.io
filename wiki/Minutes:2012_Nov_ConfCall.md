title: Minutes:2012 Nov ConfCall
---

The meeting will be held via conference call. To join the conference:

-   Dial +1-605-475-5950
-   Participant Access Code: 279610

Note that the dial-in number is not a toll-free number. Depending on the
long-distance plan on your phone, you may incur long-distance charges by
dialing in. If you are based internationally, you would incur the
applicable rate for calling a US phone number; alternatively, you can
use call-out from within Skype, which only costs a few cents in most
countries.

If you call in, please mute your phone if you aren't speaking or about
to speak, to avoid feedback loops and excessive noise or static on the
line. If your phone doesn't have a convenient mute feature, you can push
\*6 (star-6) to mute or un-mute yourself on the line.
