EU-codefest 2012 will be 19 and 20 July in Lodi Italy
=====================================================

Together with the BOSC committee we are organising the first
EU-codefest, especially for those who can not attend BOSC in California
(or, you can attend both). The EU-codefest is on 19 and 20 July 2012, in
Lodi, Italy, at the [Parco Tecnologico
Padano](http://www.tecnoparco.org/) near the Bergamo and Milano airports
(Bergamo is a hub for Ryanair).

The EU-codefest is modeled on the successful biohackathons in Japan, but
somewhat more free-flowing. In short, the focus of the EU-codefest is on
coding, open source projects, and general fun. We also hope to show BOSC
talks on video.

The weekend of 21 and 22 July we can continue (unofficially) to have a
good time, and will try to organise some outings.

Please mail **\* eucodefest2012@gmail.com \*** if you are interested in
attending. We need to get a feel for the number of people coming. But,
hey, even if it is just us we will be perfectly happy hacking away :)

Organising committee: Francesco Strozzi, Raoul Bonnal and Pjotr Prins
