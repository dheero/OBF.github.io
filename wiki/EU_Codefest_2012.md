title: EU Codefest 2012
---

EU-codefest 2012 was 19 and 20 July in Lodi Italy
=================================================

In coordination with the [BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") committee we are
organised the first EU-Codefest, a low-key event the week after [BOSC
2012](BOSC_2012 "wikilink") in California.

The EU-Codefest took place on 19 and 20 July 2012, in [Lodi,
Italy](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=45.31&lon=9.508&zoom=10&layers=M),
near the Bergamo and Milano airports (Bergamo is a hub for Ryanair).

The EU-Codefest is modeled on the successful biohackathons in Japan,
though we like it more free-flowing.

The weekend after 21 and 22 July continued (unofficially) to have a good
time, and organised some outings.

Organising committee: Francesco Strozzi, Raoul Bonnal and Pjotr Prins

- ITALY

Topics
------

Three main topics were worked on during the CodeFest:

-   NGS and high performance parsers for OpenBio projects.
-   RDF and semantic web for bioinformatics.
-   Bioinformatics pipelines definition, execution and distribution.

During the conference we discussed current issues and added

-   Service discovery and integration (Debian, BioMoby,
    biogems.info, BioLinux)
-   Workflow (bio-ngs, Galaxy, Taverna)
-   PBS (bio-ngs)
-   Software
    -   bio-ngs
    -   bio-maf introducing into pipeline
    -   gff3
    -   biogems.info (Debian packages)
    -   bio-table (RDF support)
    -   biowsr

Talks
-----

The following talks/introductons were given at the Codefest:

-   *Semantic Web for Bioinformatics* by Toshiaki Katayama, Tokyo, Japan
-   *Writing the worlds fastest GFF3 parser* by Marjan Povolni, Faculty
    of Technical Sciences Novi Sad, Serbia
-   *Software resources for Bioinformatics, including
    <http://biogems.info/>* by Pjotr Prins, Wageningen University, The
    Netherlands

Reports
-------

### Adding a list of BioLinux Software packages to biogems.info

We recognise is it often hard to find relevant information on current
software packages. At the USA codefest, a week earlier, Brad Chapman and
Hervé Ménager created a Manifest of bioinformatics packages installed on
a running CloudBiolinux system (VM). At the EU codefest a web
representation was created that parsed the manifest, pulled some more
information from the Debian package information and generates the page
<http://www.biogems.info/biolinux.html>.
