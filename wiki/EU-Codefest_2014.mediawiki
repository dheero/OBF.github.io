OBF EU-Codefest 2014 will take place on September 18th and 19th, 2014 at the EBI in Hinxton, UK, just before the [https://registration.hinxton.wellcome.ac.uk/display_info.asp?id=406 Genome Informatics Conference], which will be from September 21st to the 24th.

This is a great opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to meet and work collaboratively. We hope to
have developers from all the OpenBio, bioinformatics and scientific programming projects. Everyone is welcome to
attend!

This is the second edition of the European OBF Codefest, the [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/EU_Codefest_2012 first one] was held in 2012 in Italy. 

== Goals ==

The EU Codefest share the same [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2014#Goals goals] as the OBF Codefest, which is usually organized along with the [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC BOSC].

Since BOSC take place alternatively in the EU and USA, the EU Codefest was born two years ago to give the chance to EU based bioinformatics developers to attend, at least once per year, to an OBF Hackathon even when the BOSC is in the USA. Bioinformatics keeps growing and expanding rapidly and we believe that meeting once every two years for EU based developers is too much time. Having the chance to meet more regularly will in turn be extremely beneficial to strengthen our community, share ideas and start collaborating on new projects.

This event will be linked to the [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2014 OBF Codefest], in fact we will coordinate with the group that will meet in the USA and hopefully the EU Codefest will be a continuation of the OBF Codefest work, with people having the chance to expand on existing projects and start new ones.

== Programme ==

A detailed programme description is available on the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/course/eu-codefest EU Codefest page on the EBI website].

During the Codefest people are encouraged to work on FOSS projects. There will be a number of topics of focus:

# The OpenBio projects development (BioPerl, BioPython, BioRuby, BioJava)
# Semantic web technologies for biological data (e.g. RDF, OWL)
# Software deployment and bioinformatics pipelines, including CloudBiolinux, Docker and GNU GUIX
# NoSQL databases and NGS data mining
# Biological data visualisation with e.g. D3/JS and BioJS.

If you have another topic of interest, please contact the organisers.

== Registration ==

The Codefest will be hosted at the EBI [http://www.ebi.ac.uk Campus] in Hinxton, close to Cambridge, UK

== Travel and Accommodation ==

On the EBI page you can find more information to reach the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/travel EBI Campus].

We expect attendees to stay in Cambridge and we are organising a shuttle bus from the city centre to the EBI campus for the two days of the Codefest. To facilitate the gathering and pick up, we advise attendees to book a room in one of the following hotels:

Of course you are free to stay in other places, these hotels are just recommended as they are closer to the city centre and quite cheap.
