Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is a two-day Special
Interest Group of [ISMB](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013). It is
sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit
group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development within the biological research community.

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for
well over a decade. When the first BOSC (Bioinformatics Open Source
Conference) was held in 2000, there were already a number of popular
open source bioinformatics packages, and the number and range of these
projects has increased dramatically since then. BOSC covers the wide
range of open source bioinformatics software packages that have been
successfully developed and adopted by the community, and encompasses the
growing movement of Open Science, with its focus on transparency,
reproducibility, and data provenance. We welcome submissions relating to
all aspects of open source bioinformatics software and open science,
including new computational methods, reusable software components,
visualization, interoperability, and other approaches that help to
advance research in the biomolecular sciences. Two full days of talks,
posters, panel discussions, and informal discussion groups will enable
BOSC attendees to interact with other developers and share ideas and
code, as well as learning about some of the latest developments in the
field of open source bioinformatics.

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, follow
@BOSC2013 and use hash tag \#bosc2013.

Medical Institute's Janelia Farm, and Cameron Neylon of the Public
Library of Science.

Session Topics
--------------

-   **Open Science and Reproducible Research** -- New this year, this
    session encompasses the theory and practice of open science,
    including open notebook science, open data, transparent and
    reproducible workflows, and shared standards for reviewing and
    publishing research papers.
-   **Cloud and Parallel Computing** -- This session focuses on
    approaches that use cloud and other massively parallel
    infrastructures for processing and analyzing large and heterogeneous
    biological data. We are particularly interested in solutions
    demonstrating how to build new or extend existing software,
    resources and workflows to perform at scale for "Big Data" problems.
-   **Genome-scale Data Management** -- This session encompasses
    software and other tools designed for managing, exploring, and
    analyzing genome-level data to address research questions, including
    but not limited to genome assembly, variant prediction, eQTL
    analysis, and phylogenomic methods.
-   **Visualization** -- Current data acquisition technologies are
    moving us more and more towards a "data first, hypothesis later"
    paradigm for scientific research. As a result, data visualization
    and visual analytics are of increasing importance. This session
    focuses on approaches for interactive as well as static visual
    representations of biomedical data, ranging from exploration
    to explanation.
-   **Software Interoperability** -- This session covers Open Source
    approaches to integrating the latest bioinformatics tools. Building
    flexible, reproducible workflows with connected tools is essential
    to modern bioinformatics. The goal of this session is to investigate
    how we can increase tool connectivity and help communities work
    better together.
-   **Translational Bioinformatics** -- This session will explore
    applications of biological and medical informatics to the
    development of personalized healthcare, therapies, and a better
    understanding of human health and disease. Topics include the
    analysis of large scale population and family sequencing data,
    bioinformatics methodologies for clinical research, and tools for
    discovering clinically useful associations in human databases. We
    especially welcome work that bridges the gap between research and
    patients, making analysis tools available and understandable
    for non-scientists.
-   **Bioinformatics Open Source Project Updates** -- This session will
    feature short talks from ongoing projects describing their
    recent progress. Abstracts will be solicited from open source
    projects affiliated with the O|B|F (see
    <http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects>), including the Bio\*
    projects, DAS, BioMOBY, EMBOSS, and GMOD, but any other open-source
    project will be equally eligible to submit abstracts for
    this session.

    software](BOSC_Panel_2013 "wikilink")**

Submitting Abstracts
--------------------

The deadline for abstract submissions for talks was April 12, 2013.
Authors will be notified on May 6. [You can still submit a poster
abstract.](BOSC_Abstract_Submission "wikilink") Please submit it before
June 7 if you want it to appear in the BOSC program.

Sponsor
-------

We thank [Eagle Genomics, Ltd.](http://www.eaglegenomics.com/) for
sponsoring three Student Travel Awards at BOSC 2012. Each student winner
will receive $250 towards travel expenses. In addition, the Open
Bioinformatics Foundation will grant these three students free admission
to the conference.

Complementary Registration
--------------------------

In addition to the student awards, the Open Bioinformatics Foundation
will offer free admission to several other people whose abstracts are
accepted for talks. Please [send us a letter](mailto:bosc@open-bio.org)
explaining why you are seeking free registration for BOSC. Decisions
will be made by the BOSC organizing committee and announced on May 8,
2013.
