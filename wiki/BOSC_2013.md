Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is a satellite of
[ISMB](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013). It is sponsored by the Open
Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for
well over a decade. When the first BOSC (Bioinformatics Open Source
Conference) was held in 2000, there were already a number of popular
open source bioinformatics packages, and the number and range of these
projects has increased dramatically since then. Many open source
bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community across
a wide variety of applications. Open source bioinformatics software has
facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination, and wide adoption of new
computational methods, reusable software components, and standards.

BOSC brings together bioinformatics open source developers from all over
the world so they can forge connections each other (both within and
across projects), increase the visibility of their work, and collaborate
to build shared resources. Participants can work together to create use
cases, prototype working code, or run hands-on tutorials in new software
packages and emerging technologies. For those who are bioinformatics
software users rather than developers, BOSC introduces or updates them
on a wide array of projects that they might find useful.

### Open Source License Requirement

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which sponsors
BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open
Source Software Development within the biological research community.
For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a specific
software system for use by the research community, then that software
must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available
for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through
ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like
cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.

    Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)
