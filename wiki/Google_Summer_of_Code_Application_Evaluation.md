title: Google Summer of Code Application Evaluation
---

Originally based on the NESCent Phyloinformatics Summer of Code
procedure by Hilmar Lapp.

Overview
--------

There are 3 rounds of scoring.

Round 1: Mentors review the applications for their project idea and score them (see below for specifics).  

<!-- -->

Round 2: All mentors look at (at least) the top-scoring applications for project ideas other than their own and score them too so that we get a poll on consensus or divergence of opinions.  

<!-- -->

Round 3: Where necessary, organization admins weigh in to ensure optimal alignment with OBFs projects and objectives.  

Keep in mind that typically **fewer than 40% of project *ideas*** are
funded. Some project ideas may not receive any strong applications, so
the decision will be easier in those cases; however, we do expect that
we'll have to make some very tough calls.

With that in mind, here are suggested guidelines for scoring in the
first round.

Round 1 Scoring Guidelines
--------------------------

1.  Review the applications that you would be primary or secondary
    mentor for (this should be apparent from the title). Point out any
    missing information, lack of detail, and any aspects of a proposed
    plan that you disagree with in the comment text box, check the box
    next to 'Public review', which makes it visible to the student, and
    click 'Submit'. The student should respond to the these and can
    presumably edit his/her application to respond to your request for
    information or criticism (at least they could last year).
2.  For scoring, leave the 'Public review' box unchecked (i.e., the
    student will not see it, but other mentors will), change the *Score*
    drop-down to where you want it, add explanatory comment for your
    score, and hit 'Submit'. Scores are cumulative, so you can revert a
    score by subtracting what you previously added. Scores without
    explanatory comment are hard to weigh in the case of differing
    opinions, so please do add a brief (!) statement as why you are
    giving this score.
3.  If you are a secondary mentor, to avoid confusion I suggest you
    propose your score as a private comment (i.e., as above, except
    write the score in the comment and leave the drop-down at zero) for
    the primary mentor to take into consideration, or email the
    primary mentor.
4.  Give the top 2 or 3 applications for your idea that may warrant
    funding (see below) a graduated positive score to establish your
    preference (+4 for the best, +3 second, +2 third). Add +1 to the
    best one (for a total of +5) if your comments only point out
    refinements and in principle you're happy with the application
    as is.
5.  Only give a positive score if you have confidence that the student
    is already or would after requested improvements be worth accepting,
    and you spending your mentoring time. There may be fewer than 3 of
    those for your idea!
6.  If you are a primary mentor, request mentorship by selecting 'Wish
    to mentor' on the left hand column 'Proposal Actions' box for those
    you have scored positively. This should be no more than 3.
7.  Keep in mind for any of the above that total scores you assign
    aren't final. By adding or subtracting you can shift an application
    from one category to another, and you can withdraw your mentorship
    request later.

This should leave us with those applications that a slot is being
requested for at score +4 or +5. It would be great if we can get to this
point by Tuesday night. (Yes, you can change your mind later.)

Round 2 Scoring Guidelines
--------------------------

In the second round of scoring, all mentors will be invited to look at
all applications scored positively in the first round (except those
they'd mentor themselves), and add scores corresponding to the degree
they agree an application should receive a slot. We'll wait with this
until Tuesday and the first round is hopefully complete.

Interviews
----------

Finally, the primary (or secondary) mentors should arrange an interview
(if one has not already been done) with at least their top applicant, or
possibly the top two applicants if the decision is close. This lets the
mentor better assess the student's communication abilities and whether
personalities (yours and theirs) match well enough. The interview should
take place \*during the review period\*, the earlier the better, and you
should summarize your conclusions from it a private comment attached to
the student's proposal. The interview may be by email, chat, Skype, or
phone, depending on what you feel lets you best make the assessment.

Things to keep in mind
----------------------

1.  Your top student may also have applied to another org and may stand
    to be accepted there too. Students can only be accepted for one
    project, and hence one org; if in the end that student goes to the
    other org, you lose the slot if you don't have a second one of
    comparable quality "wait-listed", which is the reason you want to
    keep working with more than just the best one (though doing so with
    more than 3 is a waste of time).
2.  When ranking student applications against each other, weigh the
    complete picture, a significant part of which is the long-term
    prospect of the student continuing to enrich or advancing your open-
    source project or bioinformatics as a field through what you will
    teach him or her over the summer. If an application seems more solid
    technically than another but the student's career and personal
    interests and past activities suggest that he/she would likely
    disappear immediately after Summer of Code ends, would you still
    prefer to invest your mentoring time in that student? Our goal in
    participating in GSoC is not just to get things done, but to train
    and recruit future bioinformatics open-source software contributors.
