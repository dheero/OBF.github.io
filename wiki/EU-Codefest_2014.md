title: EU-Codefest 2014
---

OBF EU-Codefest 2014 will take place on September 18th and 19th, 2014 in
Cambridge, UK, just before the [Genome Informatics
Conference](https://registration.hinxton.wellcome.ac.uk/display_info.asp?id=406),
which will be from September 21st to the 24th.

This is a great opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to
meet and work collaboratively. We hope to have developers from all the
OpenBio, bioinformatics and scientific programming projects. Everyone is
welcome to attend!

This is the second edition of the European OBF Codefest, the [first
one](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/EU_Codefest_2012) was held in 2012 in
Italy.

Goals
-----

The EU Codefest share the same
[goals](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2014#Goals) as the OBF
Codefest, which is usually organized along with the
[BOSC](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC).

Since BOSC take place alternatively in the EU and USA, the EU Codefest
was born two years ago to give the chance to EU based bioinformatics
developers to attend, at least once per year, to an OBF Hackathon even
when the BOSC is in the USA. Bioinformatics keeps growing and expanding
rapidly and we believe that meeting once every two years for EU based
developers is too much time. Having the chance to meet more regularly
will in turn be extremely beneficial to strengthen our community, share
ideas and start collaborating on new projects.

This event will be linked to the [OBF
Codefest](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2014), in fact we will
coordinate with the group that will meet in the USA and hopefully the EU
Codefest will be a continuation of the OBF Codefest work, with people
having the chance to expand on existing projects and start new ones.
