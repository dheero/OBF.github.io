title: EU-Codefest 2014
---

OBF EU-Codefest 2014 will take place on September 18th and 19th, 2014 at
the EBI in Hinxton, UK, just before the [Genome Informatics
Conference](https://registration.hinxton.wellcome.ac.uk/display_info.asp?id=406),
which will be from September 21st to the 24th.

This is a great opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to
meet and work collaboratively. We hope to have developers from all the
OpenBio, bioinformatics and scientific programming projects. Everyone is
welcome to attend!

This is the second edition of the European OBF Codefest, the [first
one](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/EU_Codefest_2012) was held in 2012 in
Italy.

Goals
-----

The EU Codefest share the same
[goals](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2014#Goals) as the OBF
Codefest, which is usually organized along with the
[BOSC](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC).

Since BOSC take place alternatively in the EU and USA, the EU Codefest
was born two years ago to give the chance to EU based bioinformatics
developers to attend, at least once per year, to an OBF Hackathon even
when the BOSC is in the USA. Bioinformatics keeps growing and expanding
rapidly and we believe that meeting once every two years for EU based
developers is too much time. Having the chance to meet more regularly
will in turn be extremely beneficial to strengthen our community, share
ideas and start collaborating on new projects.

This event will be linked to the [OBF
Codefest](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2014), in fact we will
coordinate with the group that will meet in the USA and hopefully the EU
Codefest will be a continuation of the OBF Codefest work, with people
having the chance to expand on existing projects and start new ones.

Programme
---------

A detailed programme description is available on the [EU Codefest page

see latest discussions on topics and tools people are interested in
coding during the event.**

During the Codefest people are encouraged to work on FOSS projects.
There will be a number of topics of focus:

1.  The OpenBio projects development (BioPerl, BioPython,
    BioRuby, BioJava)
2.  Semantic web technologies for biological data (e.g. RDF, OWL)
3.  Software deployment and bioinformatics pipelines, including
    CloudBiolinux, Docker and GNU GUIX
4.  NoSQL databases and NGS data mining
5.  Biological data visualisation with e.g. D3/JS and BioJS.

If you have another topic of interest, please contact the organisers.

Travel and Accommodation
------------------------

On the EBI page you can find more information to reach the [EBI
Campus](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/travel).

We expect attendees to stay in Cambridge and we are organising a shuttle
bus from the city centre to the EBI campus for the two days of the
Codefest. To facilitate the gathering and pick up, we advise attendees
to book a room in one of the following hotels:

<http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/255/Cambridge-Central-hotel>

<http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/577/Cambridge-Newmarket-Road-hotel>

Of course you are free to stay in other places, these hotels are just
recommended as they are closer to the city centre and quite cheap.
