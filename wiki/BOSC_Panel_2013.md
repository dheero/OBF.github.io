Strategies for funding and maintaining open source software
-----------------------------------------------------------

Funding the ongoing maintenance and development of open-source
scientific software is a critical challenge as science becomes
increasingly reliant on interoperable tools. Ensuring the long-term
success of a scientific software project, from implementing new features
to maintaining and documenting existing features, is often challenging
due to limited resources. Maintenance issues, such as fixing bugs,
enhancing usability, or adding documentation can be especially
problematic for the health of an open-source project, creating an
environment where bioinformaticians spend an inordinate amount of work
on managing software complexity instead of solving scientific problems.

The panel will discuss current funding approaches used in open source
software development and explore approaches to help the community create
and maintain critical software:

-   Grant based: Open-source tools with a paid developer community
    supported by grants. This describes projects like Galaxy
    and Ensembl.

<!-- -->

-   Community maintained: A collection of volunteers maintain these
    tools in their spare time or as part of other research or
    development work. Some familiar examples are BioPerl, Biopython,
    BioJava, and BioRuby.

<!-- -->

-   Mixed commercial and open source: These are tools that are freely
    available to the academic/non-profit community, but require
    commercial users to pay for use. Some examples in the biology
    community are GATK and KEGG.

<!-- -->

-   Commercial value-added services: This model provides commercially
    available services on top of open-source software. Some examples in
    the larger software community are RedHat, JBoss and PostgreSQL.

The goals of the panel are to identify past approaches that have been
successful for OS scientific software, and to discuss and build
community support for long-term, sustainable development practices.
