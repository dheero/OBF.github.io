title: Open Source
---

Open source is a development methodology,\[1\] which offers practical
accessibility to a product's source (goods and knowledge). Some consider
open source as one of various possible design approaches, while others
consider it a critical strategic element of their operations. Before
open source became widely adopted, developers and producers used a
variety of phrases to describe the concept; the term open source gained
popularity with the rise of the Internet, which provided access to
diverse production models, communication paths, and interactive
communities.
