= EU-codefest 2012 was 19 and 20 July in Lodi Italy =

In coordination with the [[BOSC]] committee we are organised the first EU-Codefest, a low-key event the week after [[BOSC 2012]] in California. 

The EU-Codefest took place on 19 and 20 July 2012, in [http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=45.31&lon=9.508&zoom=10&layers=M Lodi, Italy], near the Bergamo and Milano airports (Bergamo is a hub for Ryanair).

The EU-Codefest is modeled on the successful biohackathons in Japan, though we like it more free-flowing. 

The weekend after 21 and 22 July continued (unofficially) to have a good time, and organised some outings.

Organising committee: Francesco Strozzi, Raoul Bonnal and Pjotr Prins

== Location ==

[http://www.tecnoparco.org/ Parco Tecnologico Padano]
vie Einstein - Loc. Cascina Codazza
26900, [http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=45.31&lon=9.508&zoom=10&layers=M Lodi] - ITALY

== Topics ==

Three main topics were worked on during the CodeFest:

* NGS and high performance parsers for OpenBio projects.
* RDF and semantic web for bioinformatics.
* Bioinformatics pipelines definition, execution and distribution.

During the conference we discussed current issues and added 

* Service discovery and integration (Debian, BioMoby, biogems.info, BioLinux)
* Workflow (bio-ngs, Galaxy, Taverna)
* PBS (bio-ngs)
* Software
** bio-ngs
** bio-maf introducing into pipeline
** gff3
** biogems.info (Debian packages)
** bio-table (RDF support)
** biowsr

== Talks ==

The following talks/introductons were given at the Codefest:

* ''Semantic Web for Bioinformatics'' by Toshiaki Katayama, Tokyo, Japan
* ''Writing the worlds fastest GFF3 parser'' by Marjan Povolni, Faculty of Technical Sciences Novi Sad, Serbia
* ''Software resources for Bioinformatics, including http://biogems.info/'' by Pjotr Prins, Wageningen University, The Netherlands

== Reports ==

=== Adding a list of BioLinux Software packages to biogems.info ===

We recognise is it often hard to find relevant information on current software packages.
At the USA codefest, a week earlier, Brad Chapman and Hervé Ménager created a Manifest of bioinformatics packages installed on a running CloudBiolinux system (VM). At the EU codefest
a web representation was created that parsed the manifest, pulled some more information from the Debian package information and generates the page http://www.biogems.info/biolinux.html.
