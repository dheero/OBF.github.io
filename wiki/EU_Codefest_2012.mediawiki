= EU-codefest 2012 will be 19 and 20 July in Lodi Italy =

Together with the BOSC committee we are organising the first EU-codefest, a low-key event the week after [[BOSC_2012]] in California. 

The EU-codefest is on 19 and 20 July 2012, in Lodi, Italy, near the Bergamo and Milano airports (Bergamo is a hub for Ryanair).

The EU-codefest is modeled on the successful biohackathons in Japan, but we would like it more free-flowing. There will be few invited speakers, but attendees will have a chance to give a micropresentation on their ongoing open source project. In short, the focus of the EU-codefest is on coding, open source projects, and general fun. We also hope to show BOSC talks on video.

The weekend of 21 and 22 July we can continue (unofficially) to have a good time, and will try to organise some outings.

Please mail '''* eucodefest2012@gmail.com *''' if you are interested in attending. We need to get a feel for the number of people coming. But, hey, even if it is just us we will be perfectly happy hacking away :)

Organising committee: Francesco Strozzi, Raoul Bonnal and Pjotr Prins
