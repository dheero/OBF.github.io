title: Codefest 2013
---

OpenBio Codefest 2013 will take place July 17th and 18th, 2013 (the two
days before [BOSC 2013](BOSC_2013 "wikilink")) in Berlin, Germany at
[Humboldt-Universität zu
Berlin](http://www.hu-berlin.de/?set_language=en&cl=en). This is a great
opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to meet and work
collaboratively. We hope to have developers from projects such as
[BioPerl](http://bioperl.org), [BioJava](http://www.biojava.org),
[Biopython](http://biopython.org), [BioRuby](http://www.bioruby.org),
[Galaxy](http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/) and
[GenomeSpace](http://www.genomespace.org) in attendance. Everyone is
welcome to attend.

This is a follow-up to [Codefest 2010](Codefest_2010 "wikilink") in
Boston, [Codefest 2011](Codefest_2011 "wikilink") in Vienna and
[Codefest 2012](Codefest_2012 "wikilink") in Los Angeles.

Goals
-----

OpenBio projects are typically coordinated remotely, with users from all
over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing
lists and IRC chats. Additionally, contributors work on these projects
in their spare time, coordinating improving the projects with their day
jobs and life outside of the computer. The objective of the Codefest is
to give these talented developers a chance to be fully focused on the
projects for a few days, interacting in real time. Previous
[Hackathons](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon) have been immensely
successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project
developments.

The goals for the two days are determined entirely by developers. Please
add your project ideas to the [shared Google
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xbS7ZkjipXct00eOfR7-IL_Ti6QzAsjFvcJtopMeT2g/edit?usp=sharing).
We'll use this brainstorming discussion document to prepare directions
for the two days of work in Berlin.

Location
--------

We'll be hosted in lab rooms at the [Department of Biology,
Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](http://www.biologie.hu-berlin.de/), in
the historic
[Invalidenstraße](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invalidenstra%C3%9Fe)
number 42. Here some [pictures of the
room](http://jaguar.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~ivo/ISMB/30Plaetze_alt/) to
find, here a [map of the
buildings](http://www3.hu-berlin.de/frame/?url=gis.hu-berlin.de/rc13/layout-new.php%3Fq=2220)
- enter directly from the Invalidenstraße.

    venues, hotels nearby and train stations

Accomodation
------------

The venue is in a nice area of Berlin and everyone is wholeheartedly
invited to stay nearby for the full conference. Prices vary with
availability, so book soon. Public transport in Berlin is excellent,
throughout the night, so do not worry too much if prices for the hotels
listed below have already gone through the roof. Just take anything
between our venue and the conference site. The usual internet booking
services are your friend. To increase chances for us to meet by chance,
check for one the following hotels, which should pop up when sorting for
distance from the center:

-   Hotel Aquino (55 Euros)
-   Mercure Hotel Berlin City (65 Euros)
-   Hotel Motel One Berlin Bellevue (59 Euros)
-   Gat Point Charlie (51 Euros incl. breakfast)

The Gat Point Charlie is a bit south, but it is a truly nice walk
through Berlin of 2.5km to the Codefest.

Attendees
