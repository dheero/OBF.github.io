title: Codefest 2011
---

OpenBio Codefest 2011 will take place July 13th and 14th, 2011 in
Vienna, Austria; the two days before [BOSC 2011](BOSC_2011 "wikilink").
This is a great opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to
meet and work collaboratively. We hope to have developers from projects
such as [BioPerl](http://bioperl.org),
[BioJava](http://www.biojava.org), [Biopython](http://biopython.org),
[BioRuby](http://www.bioruby.org), and [EMBOSS](http://www.emboss.org)
in attendance.

This is a follow-up to the extremely successful and fun [Codefest
2010](Codefest_2010 "wikilink") in Boston.

Goals
-----

OpenBio projects are typically coordinated remotely, with users from all
over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing
lists and IRC chats. Additionally, contributors work on these projects
in their spare time, coordinating improving the projects with their day
jobs and life outside of the computer. The objective of the Codefest is
to give these talented developers a chance to be fully focused on the
projects for a few days, interacting in real time. Previous
[Hackathons](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon) have been immensely
successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project
developments.

The goals for the two days are determined entirely by developers. We
welcome your input.

Location
--------

We are being kindly hosted by the [Metalab Hacker
space](http://metalab.at/wiki/English) in Vienna. Check out their [daily
web log](http://log.metalab.at/) to get a feel for life in the lab, and
the [Metalab Codefest
page](http://metalab.at/wiki/OpenBio_Codefest_2011).

Metalab has a nice [location map](http://metalab.at/wiki/Lage). We'll be
counting on local residents to help with additional detailed directions.
