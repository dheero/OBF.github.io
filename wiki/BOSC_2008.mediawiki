The 9th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2008) will take place in [[wp:Toronto|Toronto, Ontario, Canada]], as one of several Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings occurring in conjunction with the 16th annual Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology Conference ([http://www.iscb.org/ismb2008/ ISMB 2008]). 

=Keynote Speaker=
This year our Keynote speaker will be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Lombardi Julian Lombardi], Senior Research Scholar with Duke University.  The title of his presentation will be:

'''Croquet: An Open Collaboration Architecture for Scientific Visualization and Simulation'''

=Overview=
The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the [[OBF|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]] (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. Many Open Source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation and dissemination of new computational methods as well as informatics infrastructure. Since the work of the Open Source Bioinformatics Community represents some of the most cutting edge of Bioinformatics in general, the overall theme for the conference this year is "Tackling Hard Problems with Emerging Technologies".  Topics under this umbrella include cyberinfrastructure, grid computing and workflow management and discovery, and visualization.  We will also have a series of update talks about the main Open Source Bioinformatics Software suites. 

One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming together of the open source developer community in one location.  A face-to-face meeting of this community creates synergy where participants can work together to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies.  In short, BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done.

==Important Information for Presenters==
===Audio/Visual Resources===
* Presenters are encouraged to bring their own laptops/[http://www.research-service.com custom papers]
 for their presentations.
* If a presentor does not bring a laptop, he/she will be able to borrow one from one of the organizers.  In this case, please contact the organizing committee at [mailto:bosc%40open-bio%2eorg bosc&#64;open-bio&#46;org] to confirm arrangements.
* A high speed internet connection will be available.

===Slide Availability===
* Slides from BOSC2008 have been posted on SlideShare.  See links to slides from the [[BOSC_2008_schedule|schedule]].
* Presenters, if you have not already done so, please e-mail your slides to the organizers at [mailto:bosc%40open-bio%2eorg bosc&#64;open-bio&#46;org].

==Call for Lightning Talks/Demos/Birds of a Feather Sessions==
===Lightning Talks and Software Demonstrations===
The program committee is currently seeking speakers for the lightning talks. Lightning talks are quick - only five minutes long - and a great opportunity for you to give people a quick summary of your open source project, code, idea, or vision of the future.  Or, if you are involved in the development of novel Open Source Software, you could use the time to give a quick demonstration of your work.

If you are interested in giving a Lightning Talk or Software Demonstration at BOSC 2008, please e-mail us at [mailto:bosc%40open-bio%2eorg bosc&#64;open-bio&#46;org]:
* a brief title and summary (one or two lines)
* a URL for the project page, if applicable
* the specific open source license used for your software or your release plans (NOTE: the Open Source License Requirement also applies to Lightning talks).

We will accept entries on-line until BOSC starts, but space for demos and lightning talks is limited.

===Birds of a Feather Sessions===
One of the more popular activities at BOSC are the Birds-of-a-Feather sub-meetings that people organize at the end of each days session.  These are free-form meetings organized by the attendees themselves.  Traditionally, some BOF's have been formed to allow developers and users of individual [[OBF]] software to meet each other face-to-face to discuss the project, but other meetings have been formed to discuss completely new ideas.  These meetings offer a unique opportunity for individuals to explore more about the activities of the various Open Source Projects, and, in some cases, even take an active role influencing the future of Open Source Software development.  If you would like to create a BOF, just sign up for a [[Special:Userlogin| wiki account]], login, and edit the [[BOSC_2008/Birds-of-a-Feather]] page.

==Main Session Topics==

This year, BOSC is accepting abstract submissions on the conference theme "Tackling Hard Problems with Emerging Technologies".  The conference theme reflects that there are new technologies emerging on both the scientific front (new sequencing technologies, etc.) and the IT front (workflows, mash-up, web 2.0, improvements in all of the major programming languages, etc.), which may allow the open source community to solve problems that were previously intractable.  Abstracts may be submitted for the following topics.

'''1.  Cyberinfrastructure''' -   We are interested in presentations on topics dealing with the development of infrastructure on the web to facilitate software and data re-use (mashups, or traditional), interoperability and inter-process communication, system/service discovery, and data movement and modeling in distributed systems.  This may include peer-to-peer systems of data transfer, Web Services, various flavors of data representation (SOAP, JSON, XML, others), and technologies commonly referred to under the Web 2.0 paradigm (e.g. folksonomies/tagging, user-based content generation, content feeds, and Social Networking).

'''2.  Grid Computing and Workflow Management and Discovery''' - We particularly invite talks that report progress in making workflow systems easier to use and on how to do distributed-collaborative research , e.g. workflows that encompass the coordination of systems running in different parts of the world.

'''3.  Visualization''' - Visualization is a maturing area of open source software development.  We particularly invite talks that demonstrate innovative visualization systems, especially those which work in the context of workflows.

'''4.  Open Source Software''' - Speakers are invited to present talks on the use, development, or philosophy of open source software in bioinformatics. 

'''5.  Bio* Open Source Project Updates''' - We invite abstracts from the representatives of the open source projects sponsored by or affiliated to the O|B|F (see [[Projects|Projects]]).

===How Do I Submit?===
The deadline for abstract submissions for full presentations was May 11, 2008.
Abstract submissions were not accepted via e-mail this year.  All abstracts were submitted through our [http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2008/openconf.php Open Conference Systems] site. ''Note: the BOSC 2008 OCS site has been taken down.  If you need to access this site, you should contact the current BOSC organizers at [mailto:bosc@open-bio.org bosc@open-bio.org].  &mdash; [[User:Kdahlquist|Kdahlquist]]; 00:42, 4 December 2009 (UTC)''

You will need to prepare a short, 50-word abstract, and a full abstract to upload as a PDF file or plain text file.  Full abstracts must be one page in length.  Place the title and authors of the abstract at the top of the page and use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom of the page.

NOTE: The Open Conference Systems abstract submission system will tell you to upload a "paper". This refers to your one-page full abstract. The one-page abstract will appear in the SIG booklet distributed by ISMB and no other papers will be published from this conference. There will not be a poster session at BOSC, only presentations.

Accepted talks will be 10-20 minutes, depending on the session. You will be notified of the length of your talk upon abstract acceptance.
