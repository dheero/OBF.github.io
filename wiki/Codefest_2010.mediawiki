OpenBio Codefest 2010 will take place July 7th and 8th, 2010 in conjunction with [[BOSC 2010]]. This is an opportunity for OpenBio developers from projects like [http://bioperl.org BioPerl], [http://www.biojava.org BioJava], [http://biopython.org Biopython], [http://www.bioruby.org BioRuby], and [http://www.emboss.org EMBOSS] to work collaboratively on improving Open Source Bioinformatics code.

== Goals ==

OpenBio projects are typically coordinated remotely, with users from all over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing lists and IRC chats. Additionally, contributors work on these projects in their spare time, coordinating improving the projects with their day jobs and life outside of the computer.
The objective of the Codefest is to give these talented developers a chance to be fully focused on the projects for a few days, interacting in real time. Previous [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon Hackathons] have been immensely successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project developments.

The general aim of the Codefest is improving the accessibility, functionality and interoperability of the existing libraries. The specific goals are determined based on the interests of attending members and inputs of sponsors. Some current areas of topic discussion are:

=== Cloud computing ===

Improving the presence of OpenBio libraries on distributed computing environments like [http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud] and [http://open.eucalyptus.com/ Eucalyptus]. Ntino has written up an excellent project proposal available for [http://www.open-bio.org/w/images/8/85/BOSC_2010_Cloud_BioLinux.pdf download in pdf format].

Initial work has started to develop an automated build environment that incorporates the [http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/jcvi-cloud-biolinux/overview/ Cloud BioLinux] and [http://fortinbras.us/bioperl-max/ bioperl-max] efforts. See the [http://bcbio.wordpress.com/2010/05/08/automated-build-environment-for-bioinformatics-cloud-images/ blog post] for full details. Code and configuration files are available from a [http://github.com/chapmanb/bcbb/tree/master/ec2/biolinux/ GitHub repository]. The post outlines several areas of improvements which could be targets for focused work at the Codefest.

== Resources ==

* [http://aws.amazon.com/ Amazon Web Services] -- We will be able to use EC2 and other Amazon services thanks to [http://aws.amazon.com/education/ Amazon grant] support for a proposal put together by Steffan Moellar. Many thanks to Amazon for supporting the initiative and Steffan for putting together the application.
* [http://www.eucalyptus.com/ Eucalyptus] -- The [http://www.uk-sh.de/index.phtml?NavID=676.467.4&La=4&switch_la=1&back_qs=NavID%3D676.467.4 Universit√§tsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein] is sponsoring a 12 node local Eucalyptus cloud for testing and development. Thanks again to Steffan for making this available.

== Sponsorship ==

Space and internet for the Codefest are kindly provided by the [http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ Harvard School of Public Health] and [http://www.mgh.harvard.edu/ Massachusetts General Hospital]. We are actively seeking sponsors to help supplement the travel, lodging and meal costs for developers.
