title: Codefest
---

In recent years, typically before each annual [BOSC](BOSC "wikilink")
meeting the OBF has organised an informal two day "Coding Festival", or
Codefest. Like similar "[Hackathon](Hackathon "wikilink")" (hacking
marathon) or programming "Sprint" events, these are programmer
orientated and are intended to foster collaborations amongst the
international bioinformatics community.
