Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is a two-day Special
Interest Group of ISMB. It is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics
Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the
practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the
biological research community.

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for
well over a decade. When the first BOSC (Bioinformatics Open Source
Conference) was held in 2000, there were already a number of popular
open source bioinformatics packages, and the number and range of these
projects has increased dramatically since then. BOSC covers the wide
range of open source bioinformatics software packages that have been
successfully developed and adopted by the community, and encompasses the
growing movement of Open Science, with its focus on transparency,
reproducibility, and data provenance. We welcome submissions relating to
all aspects of open source bioinformatics software and open science,
including new computational methods, reusable software components,
visualization, interoperability, and other approaches that help to
advance research in the biological sciences. Two full days of talks,
posters, panel discussions, and informal discussion groups will enable
BOSC attendees to interact with other developers and share ideas and
code, as well as learning about some of the latest developments in the
field of open source bioinformatics.

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [follow

Session Topics
--------------

-   **Open Science and Reproducible Research** -- covers the theory and
    practice of open science, including open notebook science, open
    data, transparent and reproducible workflows, and shared standards
    for reviewing and publishing research papers.
-   **Software Interoperability** -- includes Open Source approaches to
    integrating the latest bioinformatics tools, exploring how we can
    increase tool connectivity and help communities work
    better together.
-   **Genome-scale Data and Beyond** -- encompasses software and other
    tools designed for managing, exploring, and analyzing large-scale
    data to address research questions, such as genome assembly, variant
    prediction, eQTL analysis, phylogenomics, and epigenetics.
-   **Visualization** -- focuses on approaches for interactive as well
    as static visual representations of biomedical data, ranging from
    exploration to explanation.
-   Translational Bioinformatics -- explores applications of biological
    and medical informatics to the development of personalized
    healthcare, therapies, and a better understanding of human health
    and disease. Topics include the analysis of large scale population
    and family sequencing data, bioinformatics methodologies for
    clinical research, and tools for discovering clinically useful
    associations in human databases.
-   **Bioinformatics Open Source Project Updates** -- features short
    talks from ongoing projects describing their recent progress.
    Abstracts will be solicited from open source projects affiliated
    with the O|B|F (see <http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects>),
    including the Bio\* projects, DAS, BioMOBY, EMBOSS, and GMOD, but
    any other open-source project will be equally eligible to submit
    abstracts for this session.
-   **Panel**: Reproducibility: Rewards and Challenges

Keynote Speakers
----------------

This year's keynote speakers will be C. Titus Brown (Michigan State
University) and Philip Bourne (NIH).
