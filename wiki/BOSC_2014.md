Convention Center in Boston on July 11-12, right before [ISMB
2014](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2014) as one of the official ISMB SIG

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is run as a two-day
meeting before the annual ISMB conference. It is sponsored by the Open
Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development and Open Science within the biological research community.

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for
well over a decade. When the first BOSC (Bioinformatics Open Source
Conference) was held in 2000, there were already a number of popular
open source bioinformatics packages, and the number and range of these
projects has increased dramatically since then. covers the wide range of
open source bioinformatics software being developed, and encompasses the
growing movement of Open Science, with its focus on transparency,
reproducibility, and data provenance. We welcome submissions relating to
all aspects of bioinformatics and open science software, including new
computational methods, reusable software components, visualization,
interoperability, and other approaches that help to advance research in
the biomolecular sciences. Two full days of talks, posters, panel
discussions, and informal discussion groups will enable BOSC attendees
to interact with other developers and share ideas and code, as well as
learning about some of the latest developments in the field of open
source bioinformatics.

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [follow

Registration
------------

Because BOSC is run as a two-day Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting at
the annual ISMB conference, [registration is via ISMB
2014](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2014-registration). You can attend just
BOSC, or combine this with attending the full ISMB conference as well.

Note that this year we have [waived the BOSC registration fee for
student presenters of full-length
talks](http://news.open-bio.org/news/2014/03/free-student-presenters-bosc-2014/).

If you need a formal invitation letter for your USA VISA application,
please contact the ISMB:

Sponsors
--------

BOSC is organised by the [Open Bioinformatics

dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development and Open Science within the biological research
community.

Session Topics
--------------

-   **Open Science and Reproducible Research** -- covers the theory and
    practice of open science, including open notebook science, open
    data, transparent and reproducible workflows, and shared standards
    for reviewing and publishing research papers.
-   **Software Interoperability** -- includes Open Source approaches to
    integrating the latest bioinformatics tools, exploring how we can
    increase tool connectivity and help communities work
    better together.
-   **Genome-scale Data and Beyond** -- encompasses software and other
    tools designed for managing, exploring, and analyzing large-scale
    data to address research questions, such as genome assembly, variant
    prediction, eQTL analysis, phylogenomics, and epigenetics.
-   **Visualization** -- focuses on approaches for interactive as well
    as static visual representations of biomedical data, ranging from
    exploration to explanation.
-   **Translational Bioinformatics** -- explores applications of
    biological and medical informatics to the development of
    personalized healthcare, therapies, and a better understanding of
    human health and disease. Topics include the analysis of large scale
    population and family sequencing data, bioinformatics methodologies
    for clinical research, and tools for discovering clinically useful
    associations in human databases.
