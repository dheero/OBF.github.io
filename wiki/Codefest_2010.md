title: Codefest 2010
---

OpenBio Codefest 2010 will take place July 7th and 8th, 2010 in
conjunction with [BOSC 2010](BOSC_2010 "wikilink"). This is an
opportunity for OpenBio developers from projects like
[BioPerl](http://bioperl.org), [BioJava](http://www.biojava.org),
[Biopython](http://biopython.org), [BioRuby](http://www.bioruby.org),
and [EMBOSS](http://www.emboss.org) to work collaboratively on improving
Open Source Bioinformatics code.

Goals
-----

OpenBio projects are typically coordinated remotely, with users from all
over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing
lists and IRC chats. Additionally, contributors work on these projects
in their spare time, coordinating improving the projects with their day
jobs and life outside of the computer. The objective of the Codefest is
to give these talented developers a chance to be fully focused on the
projects for a few days, interacting in real time. Previous
[Hackathons](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon) have been immensely
successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project
developments.

The general aim of the Codefest is improving the accessibility,
functionality and interoperability of the existing libraries. The
specific goals are determined based on the interests of attending
members and inputs of sponsors. Some current areas of topic discussion
are:

-   Improving the presence of OpenBio libraries on distributed computing
    environments like [Amazon Elastic Compute
    Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and
    [Eucalyptus](http://open.eucalyptus.com/). Ntino has written up an
    excellent project proposal available for [download in pdf
    format](http://www.open-bio.org/w/images/8/85/BOSC_2010_Cloud_BioLinux.pdf).
