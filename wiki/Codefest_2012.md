title: Codefest 2012
---

OpenBio Codefest 2012 will take place July 11th and 12th, 2012 (the two
days before [BOSC 2012](BOSC_2012 "wikilink")) in Los Angeles,
California at [Loyola Marymount University](http://www.lmu.edu/). This
is a great opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to meet
and work collaboratively. We hope to have developers from projects such
as [BioPerl](http://bioperl.org), [BioJava](http://www.biojava.org),
[Biopython](http://biopython.org), [BioRuby](http://www.bioruby.org),
[Galaxy](http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/) and [EMBOSS](http://www.emboss.org)
in attendance.

This is a follow-up to [Codefest 2010](Codefest_2010 "wikilink") in
Boston and [Codefest 2011](Codefest_2011 "wikilink") in Vienna.

Goals
-----

OpenBio projects are typically coordinated remotely, with users from all
over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing
lists and IRC chats. Additionally, contributors work on these projects
in their spare time, coordinating improving the projects with their day
jobs and life outside of the computer. The objective of the Codefest is
to give these talented developers a chance to be fully focused on the
projects for a few days, interacting in real time. Previous
[Hackathons](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon) have been immensely
successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project
developments.

The goals for the two days are determined entirely by developers. We
welcome your input. Please add your thoughts to the shared Google
document:

Location
--------

We are being hosted by the [math department at
LMU](http://cse.lmu.edu/departments/math.htm).

Many thanks to Kam Dahlquist for help in organizing.

Travel and Hotels
-----------------

LMU is located a short cab ride from [Los Angeles International Airport
(LAX)](http://www.lawa.org/welcomeLAX.aspx). Logistically, we hope
attendees will fly into LAX, spend the Codefest time at a hotel near
LMU, and then travel down to Long Beach on the night of the 12th for
BOSC and ISMB.

We will work to arrange group transport from LMU to Long Beach on the
night of the 12th.

There are several hotels nearby:

-   [Custom
    Hotel](http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/losangeles/custom_hotel)
    (within walking distance of the math department) -- [Register with
