title: Codefest 2012
---

OpenBio Codefest 2012 will take place July 11th and 12th, 2012 (the two
days before [BOSC 2012](BOSC_2012 "wikilink")) in Los Angeles,
California at [Loyola Marymount University](http://www.lmu.edu/). This
is a great opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to meet
and work collaboratively. We hope to have developers from projects such
as [BioPerl](http://bioperl.org), [BioJava](http://www.biojava.org),
[Biopython](http://biopython.org), [BioRuby](http://www.bioruby.org),
[Galaxy](http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/) and [EMBOSS](http://www.emboss.org)
in attendance.

This is a follow-up to [Codefest 2010](Codefest_2010 "wikilink") in
Boston and [Codefest 2011](Codefest_2011 "wikilink") in Vienna.

Goals
-----

OpenBio projects are typically coordinated remotely, with users from all
over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing
lists and IRC chats. Additionally, contributors work on these projects
in their spare time, coordinating improving the projects with their day
jobs and life outside of the computer. The objective of the Codefest is
to give these talented developers a chance to be fully focused on the
projects for a few days, interacting in real time. Previous
[Hackathons](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon) have been immensely
successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project
developments.

The goals for the two days are determined entirely by developers. We
welcome your input. Please add your thoughts to the shared Google
document:

-   During the Codefest, on IRC (freenode/\#codefest)

Location and Time
-----------------

We are being hosted by the [math department at
LMU](http://cse.lmu.edu/departments/math.htm).

-   The Math Department at LMU is in University Hall Suite 2700. We will
    have several rooms and a lounge area to spread out and work in.
-   Kam will be there at 9:00 AM on Wednesday to make sure the rooms are
    open and to greet people.

### Directions if you are driving

-   Use the address

`1 LMU Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90045`

  
in your favorite mapping program. This will give you directions to the
main entrance to campus. University Hall is the first building on the
right as you enter campus. There is underground parking underneath
this building. Parking is free on the P2 and P3 levels. Take an elevator
up to the second floor; Suite 2700 is on the West side of the building.

### Directions if you are walking from the Custom Hotel

-   When you leave the hotel, head South on Lincoln Boulevard and cross
    over to the other side of the street at one of the stop lights. You
    will pass three stop lights at Manchester, 84th St., and 83rd St.
    Then you will go down a hill and see some fountains on the
    right side. This is the entrance to campus. University Hall is the
    large building immediately on your right as you enter campus. There
    is an entrance to the building on the side facing Lincoln, but it
    can be tricky to find. If you continue walking on the sidewalk next
    to the building, you will find another entrance at the other end of
    the building. Suite 2700 is on the second floor, closer to the
    Lincoln side of the building.

### Directions from other hotels

-   Most likely a taxi driver will be familiar with finding the campus.
    Otherwise, use the driving directions above. The other hotels are
    probably not within easy walking distance.

Travel and Hotels
-----------------

LMU is located a short cab ride from [Los Angeles International Airport
(LAX)](http://www.lawa.org/welcomeLAX.aspx). Logistically, we hope
attendees will fly into LAX, spend the Codefest time at a hotel near
LMU, and then travel down to Long Beach on the night of the 12th for
BOSC and ISMB.

We will work to arrange group transport from LMU to Long Beach on the
night of the 12th.

There are several hotels nearby:

-   [Custom
    Hotel](http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/losangeles/custom_hotel)
    (within walking distance of the math department) -- [Register with
