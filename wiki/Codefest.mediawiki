In recent years, typically before each annual [[BOSC]] meeting the OBF has organised an informal two day "Coding Festival", or Codefest. Like similar "[[Hackathon]]" (hacking marathon) or programming "Sprint" events, these are programmer orientated and are intended to foster collaborations amongst the international bioinformatics community.
