The details of each of our project ideas are listed below, including potential mentors. Interested mentors and students should subscribe to the OBF/GSoC [http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc mailing list] and announce their interest.

See the main OBF [[Google Summer of Code]] page for more information about the GSoC program and additional ways to get in touch with us.


==Cross-project ideas==

OBF is an umbrella organization which represents many different programming languages used in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics bioinformatics]. In addition to working with each of the "Bio*" projects (listed below), this year we are also accepting a category of "cross-project" ideas that cover multiple programming languages or projects. These collaborative ideas are broadly defined and can be thought of as "unfinished" &mdash; interested students should adapt the ideas to their own strengths and goals, and are responsible for the quality of the final proposed idea in their application.

'''Feel free to propose your own entirely new idea'''. You can also draw ideas from [http://gmod.org/wiki/GSoC#2014_Project_Ideas Genome Informatics (GMOD)] and the [http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2014 National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent)].

==[http://biojava.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code BioJava] and JSBML==

* [http://biojava.org/wiki/BioJava:Modules BioJava modules] as another source for student-conceived project ideas
* Source code for [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biojava/browse/biojava-live/trunk biojava-live] (the main BioJava code base) and [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biojava/ all BioJava sub-projects]

For GSoC 2014, BioJava is partnering with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SMBL) team to bring enhancements to JSBML, the standard Java implementation of SBML, and bring SBML features to other Java-based systems biology software. See [http://sbml.org/GSoC2014 the SMBL website] for more ideas from the SBML team.

Students working on these projects will interact with both the BioJava and JSBML communities, which overlap. Most development will happen on the JSBML codebase, although BioJava is used as a supporting library for some components.
