If you would like to organize a Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting, just
sign up for a [ wiki account](Special:Userlogin "wikilink"), login, and
edit this page. Please list the BOF topic and the name of the organizer.

The BOFs are from 5:30-6:30 in the same room as the BOSC talks (F2).

Friday BOFs (Day 1)
-------------------

-   Galaxy and Taverna working together (Marco Roos)

  
  
Galaxy and Taverna are both workflow systems with different strengths.
It is in the interest of users if they can be used together, while each
keeps extending their strong points. A tool to generate Galaxy tools
from Taverna workflows has already been developed and in a previous
meeting we concluded that allowing Galaxy and Taverna Server to work
from one (virtual) box could be the next step. In this BOF we discuss
how we could make the tools benefit most from working together and what
additional requirements that might set. Developers of both Galaxy and
Taverna will participate in this BOF, and we welcome
interested (potential) users and developers.

Saturday BOFs (Day 2)
---------------------

-   [Goby Framework](http://campagnelab.org/software/goby/) and APIs.
    Organizer: Fabien Campagne.

  
  
Goby offers an efficient framework to store and work with large volumes
of NGS data. Developers interested in implementing Goby support in NGS
tools, and/or end users interested in using the Goby toolbox are
encouraged to attend to meet and chat with the developers.

-   Hands-on to prepare a Debian package for your software. Organizer:
    Steffen MÃ¶ller

  
  
Walk through the Debian Med repository on build instructions for
biological software, preparation of a package for your source code,
identification of what is missing in Debian/Ubuntu to help your
daily routine.
