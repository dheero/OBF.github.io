===Call for Speakers and Abstracts===
The BOSC organizing committee is currently seeking abstracts
for talks at BOSC 2006.  BOSC is a great opportunity for you to tell the community about 
your use, development, or philosophy of open source software development 
in bioinformatics. The committee will select several submitted abstracts 
for 25-minute talks and others for shorter "lightning" talks. Accepted 
abstracts will be published on the BOSC web site.


If you are interested in speaking at BOSC 2006, 
 please send us before June 5th, 2006:
 
 * an abstract (no more than a few paragraphs)
 * a URL for the project page, if applicable
 * information about the open source license used for your software or 
   your release plans.

Abstracts will be accepted for submission until June 5th, 2006.
Abstracts chosen for presentation will be announced June 19th, 2006 
(before the ISMB Early Registration Deadline).
