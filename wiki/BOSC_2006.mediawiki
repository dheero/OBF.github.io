==Agenda==

===Notes on Submissions===
* The Open Bioinformatics Foundation is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software development within the Biological Research Community.  To promote this mission, the organizing committee will favor submissions for projects that apply a recognized Open Source License, or adhere to the general Open Source Philosophy.

See the following websites for further details:
* [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ Recognized Open Source Licenses]
* [http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php Definition of the Open Source Philosophy]

===Call for Speakers and Abstracts===
The BOSC organizing committee is currently seeking abstracts for talks at BOSC 2006.  BOSC is a great opportunity for you to tell the community about your use, development, or philosophy of open source software development in bioinformatics. The committee will select several submitted abstracts for 25-minute talks. Accepted abstracts will be published on the BOSC web site.

If you are interested in speaking at BOSC 2006, please send us before '''June 5th, 2006''': 
* an abstract (no more than a few paragraphs)
* a URL for the project page, if applicable
* information about the open source license used for your software or your release plans.

Abstracts will be accepted for submission until June 5th, 2006.  Abstracts chosen for presentation will be announced June 19th, 2006 (before the [[ISMB]] Early Registration Deadline).

===Call for Lightning Talks and Demos===
The program committee is currently seeking speakers for the lightning talks. Lightning talks are quick - only five minutes long - and a great opportunity for you to give people a quick summary of your open source project, code, idea, or vision of the future.  Or, if you are involved in the development of novel Open Source Software, you could use the time to give a quick demonstration of your work.

If you are interested in giving a Lightning Talk or Software Demonstration at BOSC 2006, please send us:
* a brief title and summary (one or two lines)
* a URL for the project page, if applicable
* information about the open source license used for your software or your release plans.

We will accept entries on-line until BOSC starts, but space for demos and lightning talks is limited.

===Call for Birds of a Feather Meeting Ideas===

One of the more popular activities at BOSC are the Birds-of-a-Feather sub meetings that people organize at the end of each days session.  These are free form meetings organized by the attendees themselves.  Traditionally, some BOF's have been formed to allow developers and users of individual [[OBF]] software to meet each other face-to-face to discuss the project, but other meetings have been formed to discuss completely new ideas.  These meetings offer a unique opportunity for individuals to explore more
about the activities of the various Open Source Projects, and, in some cases, even take an active role influencing the future of Open Source Software development.  If
you would like to create a BOF, just sign up for a wiki account, login, and edit the [[BOSC_2006/Birds-of-a-Feather]] page.

===Call for Volunteers===
The BOSC Organizing Committee would like to invite attendees
to take a more active role in making BOSC a successful conference
by volunteering your services.  The following opportunities for 
assistance exist:

* Set up, Clean up:  Volunteers are needed to help set up and clean up any aspects of the conference room that are not done so by the conference organizers.

* Chair Talk and Lightning Talk Sessions:  Volunteers would be asked to manage a session of between 4-6 speakers.  They would introduce each speaker, and manage the timing of their talks.

* Historian: Volunteer(s) would record the speaker, title, date, and time of each talk, and/or take digital photographs of speakers, attendees, etc, for inclusion on the BOSC 2006 website.  Others might be interested in podcasting the event.

* Other general assistance: we always need people to help out for things like passing microphones around to audience questioners, helping speakers transfer their presentation media between computers, etc.

If you would like to become more involved with the BOSC conference, please email us your name, contact information, and where you would prefer to help out.
