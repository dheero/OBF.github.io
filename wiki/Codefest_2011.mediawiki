OpenBio Codefest 2011 will take place July 13th and 14th, 2011 in Vienna, Austria; the two days before [[BOSC 2011]]. This is a great opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to meet and work collaboratively. We hope to have developers from projects such as [http://bioperl.org BioPerl], [http://www.biojava.org BioJava], [http://biopython.org Biopython], [http://www.bioruby.org BioRuby], and [http://www.emboss.org EMBOSS] in attendance.

This is a follow-up to the extremely successful and fun [[Codefest 2010]] in Boston.

== Goals ==

OpenBio projects are typically coordinated remotely, with users from all over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing lists and IRC chats. Additionally, contributors work on these projects in their spare time, coordinating improving the projects with their day jobs and life outside of the computer.
The objective of the Codefest is to give these talented developers a chance to be fully focused on the projects for a few days, interacting in real time. Previous [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon Hackathons] have been immensely successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project developments.

The goals for the two days are determined entirely by developers. We welcome your input.

== Location ==

We are being kindly hosted by the [http://metalab.at/wiki/English Metalab Hacker space] in Vienna. Check out their [http://log.metalab.at/ daily web log] to get a feel for life in the lab, and the [http://metalab.at/wiki/OpenBio_Codefest_2011 Metalab Codefest page].

Metalab has a nice [http://metalab.at/wiki/Lage location map]. We'll be counting on local residents to help with additional detailed directions.

== Attendees ==

You are very welcome to attend. Please add yourself if you are interested to [https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Agxg-o4ZmoZ4dHQxWEV1aW1raFJKbWxrMk80RDZSOVE&hl=en&authkey=CK3mo_4B this Google spreadsheet]. New user registration on the Codefest Wiki is temporarily disabled due to spam.
