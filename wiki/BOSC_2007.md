The 8th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference
([BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") 2007) will *tenatively* take place in [Vienna,
Austria](wp:Vienna,_Austria "wikilink"), as one of several Special
Interest Group (SIG) meetings occurring in conjunction with the [15th
International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2007/).

We have submitted a proposal for BOSC to be held at ISMB2007 but are
still waiting for notification that it is approved.
