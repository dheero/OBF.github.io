![The Bosc Pair](Pear.png "The Bosc Pair")

The 8th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference
([BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") 2007) will take place in [Vienna,
Austria](wp:Vienna,_Austria "wikilink"), as one of several Special
Interest Group (SIG) meetings occurring in conjunction with the [15th
International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2007/).

This year is shaping up to be very exciting. We have changed our format
to add room for more development oriented talks and discussions, in an
effort to fully utilize the conference to stimulate new development
efforts in all areas of Open Source Bioinformatics Software development.
The primary focus of the conference revolves around the delineation of
areas of IT or Bioinformatics which are not well serviced by existing
toolkits. The Keynote session will be headed up by [Carole
Goble](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~carole/), of Manchester University.
Speakers in this session will be invited to present detailed
descriptions of an 'Intractible Problem In Bioinformatics'. The last
session of the conference has been setup for speakers to present ideas
for solving any of the problems presented in the keynote session. Other
sessions will be set up to allow presentations on new Software Design
Patterns, Software Engineering ideas, and more traditional BOSC talks
(see below for details and deadlines). There will be a session of talks
by developers in the major Bio\* projects giving overviews of recent
developments in their projects. Finally, the Birds of a Feather sessions
will be enhanced with wifi to create 'Wifi Workshops'. All in all, this
should be a great conference.

<u>**UPDATE:**</u> Dr. Carole Goble's slides are now available on

Agenda

### Notes on Submissions

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which is the sole
sponsor of BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy
of Open Source Software Development within the Biological Research
Community. For this reason, in order to be considered for acceptance,
any talk submitted to be presented at BOSC which concerns a specific
software system to be used by the research community must be licensed
with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download by
anyone using ftp, cvs/subversion, or as a tar/zip file from the Project
Website.

See the following websites for further details:

-   [Recognized Open Source
    Licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/)
-   [Definition of the Open Source
    Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)

All submissions should be emailed to the BOSC mailing list at
**bosc@open-bio.org**.

### Call for Speakers and Abstracts

This year BOSC is requesting submissions for a variety of different
venues. All submissions should be recieved by Monday, May 14th to be
considered for inclusion:

1.  Currently Intractable Problems In Bioinformatics: This session will
    follow the Keynote, and will be devoted to the delineation of areas
    of Bioinformatics or Information Technology which are currently not
    solved or serviced by the current suite of Bioinformatics Software
    in existence. Speakers are invited to submit a detailed use case
    which currently cannot be satisfied with readily available toolkits
    and a summary of the problem sufficient to engage developers into
    discussions on how to solve the problem. The last venue of day two
    will be devoted to allow attendees to present ideas for solving
    these problems. Talks for both venues will be 5 minutes long, with a
    few minutes for questions from the audience. All problems, and ideas
    for solution will be published on the BOSC web site.
2.  New Informatics Technologies in Bioinformatics: This venue is
    devoted to developments of Open Source Software which enables others
    to deploy newer Information Technology systems, such as
    Peer-to-Peer, zeroconf, and WebServices (SOAP or REST),
    Folksonomies/Tagging, RSS, Social Networking, and other design
    patterns collectively described as [web
    2.0](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html),
    or which makes heavy use of these systems. Talks will be 10 minutes
    long, with a few minutes for questions from the audience. All
    abstracts will be published on the BOSC website.
3.  Open Source Software Presentations: This venue will allow speakers
    to present talks on their use, development, or philosophy of open
    source software in bioinformatics to the BOSC attendees. The
    committee will select several submitted abstracts for 10-minute
    talks, with a few minutes for questions afterwards. Accepted
    abstracts will be published on the BOSC web site.
4.  Discussions of Software Design and Engineering: This venue will
    allow speakers to to present Design Practices in their Open Source
    Project, or an Open Source Project they have used and were happy
    with, or present ideas on the practice of Software Design which
    would benifit the Open Source Developer Community. Talks will be 5
    minutes long, with a few minutes for questions afterwards. Accepted
    abstracts will be published on the BOSC web site.

All submissions must be sent, along with the following information, to
the bosc mailing list (**bosc@open-bio.org**) by May 14th, 2007:

1.  Abstract (no more than a few paragraphs) or Use Case
2.  Open Source License (if talking about your Software)
3.  project website (if talking about your Software)
4.  at least one contact email (personal or list)

Accepted speakers will be contacted by the BOSC organizing committee on
May 28, 2007.

### Call For Wifi Workshops

This year, the BOSC committee will enhance the infrastructure for what
were currently labelled Birds of a Feather sessions with a wireless
router. This will allow groups to interact with software or websites
much more while they are discussing their favourite projects. The BOSC
committee will accept ideas for these up to the last day of the
conference, on a first come-first-served basis until no more space is
left in the conference room.

### Let's Create an OBF Software CD!

This year we will be devoting a small BOSC session to the task of laying
the groundwork for the creation and management of a single CD of OBF
applications, and libraries for easy installation. The goal is to start
the process of [ creating a CD](BOSC/liveCD "wikilink") to distribute
for the next BOSC.

### Call for Volunteers

The BOSC Organizing Committee would like to invite attendees to take a
more active role in making BOSC a successful conference by volunteering
your services. The following opportunities for assistance exist:

-   Set up, Clean up: Volunteers are needed to help set up and clean up
    any aspects of the conference room that are not done by the
    conference organizers.
-   Historian/Photographers: Volunteers are needed to help record
    aspects about BOSC 2007 for future reference. Possibilities include
    blogging the conference, writing up a review article for the
    ISCB, etc.. The Photographer will take digital photographs of all
    speakers, recording each speakers name with their image name for
    easy inclusion on the BOSC summary website after the conference.
    Pictures from past [Past BOSC
    conferences](Past_BOSC_conferences "wikilink") are available in [our
    gallery](http://gallery.open-bio.org).
