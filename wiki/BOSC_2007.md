![The Bosc Pair](Pear.png "The Bosc Pair")

The 8th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference
([BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") 2007) will take place in [Vienna,
Austria](wp:Vienna,_Austria "wikilink"), as one of several Special
Interest Group (SIG) meetings occurring in conjunction with the [15th
International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2007/).

This year is shaping up to be very exciting. We have changed our format
to add room for more development oriented talks and discussions, in an
effort to fully utilize the conference to stimulate new development
efforts in all areas of Open Source Bioinformatics Software development.
The primary focus of the conference revolves around the delineation of
areas of IT or Bioinformatics which are not well serviced by existing
toolkits. The Keynote session will be headed up by Carol Goble, of
Manchester University. Speakers in this session will be invited to
present detailed descriptions of an 'Intractible Problem In
Bioinformatics'. The last session of the conference has been setup for
speakers to present ideas for solving any of the problems presented in
the keynote session. Other sessions will be set up to allow
presentations on new Software Design Patterns, Software Engineering
ideas, and more traditional BOSC talks (see below for details and
deadlines). There will be a session of talks by developers in the major
Bio\* projects giving overviews of recent developments in their
projects. Finally, the Birds of a Feather sessions will be enhanced with
wifi to create 'Wifi Workshops'. All in all, this should be a great
conference.

### Notes on Submissions

`The Open Bioinformatics Foundation is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software development within the `  
`Biological Research Community. To promote this mission, the organizing committee will favor submissions for projects that apply a recognized `  
`Open Source License, or adhere to the general Open Source Philosophy.`

See the following websites for further details:

-   [Recognized Open Source
    Licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/)

    Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)

All submissions should be emailed to the BOSC mailing list at
**bosc@open-bio.org**.

### Call for Speakers and Abstracts

This year BOSC is requesting submissions for a variety of different
venues. All submissions should be recieved by Monday, May 14th to be
considered for inclusion:

1.  Currently Intractable Problems In Bioinformatics: This session will
    follow the Keynote, and will be devoted to the delineation of areas
    of Bioinformatics or Information Technology which are currently not
    solved or serviced by the current suite of Bioinformatics Software
    in existence. Speakers are invited to submit a detailed use case
    which currently cannot be satisfied with readily available toolkits
    and a summary of the problem sufficient to engage developers into
    discussions on how to solve the problem. The last venue of day two
    will be devoted to allow attendees to present ideas for solving
    these problems. Talks for both venues will be 5 minutes long, with a
    few minutes for questions from the audience. All problems, and ideas
    for solution will be published on the BOSC web site.
2.  New Informatics Technologies in Bioinformatics: This venue is
    devoted to the development of systems which make use of newer
    Information Technology practices, such as WebServices (SOAP or
    REST), Folksonomies/Tagging, RSS, Social Networking, and other
    design patterns collectively described as [web
    2.0](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html).
    Talks will be 10 minutes long, with a few minutes for questions from
    the audience. All abstracts will be published on the BOSC website.
3.  Open Source Software Presentations: This venue will allow speakers
    to present talks on their use, development, or philosophy of open
    source software in bioinformatics to the BOSC attendees. The
    committee will select several submitted abstracts for 10-minute
    talks, with a few minutes for questions afterward. Accepted
    abstracts will be published on the BOSC web site.
4.  Discussions of Software Design and Engineering: This venue will
    allow speakers to to present Design Practices in their Open Source
    Project, or an Open Source Project they have used and were happy
    with, or present ideas on the practice of Software Design which
    would benifit the Open Source Developer Community. Talks will be 5
    minutes long, with a few minutes for questions afterward. Accepted
    abstracts will be published on the BOSC web site.

All submissions must be sent, along with the following information, to
the bosc mailing list (**bosc@open-bio.org**):

1.  Abstract (no more than a few paragraphs) or Use Case
2.  Open Source License (if talking about your Software)
3.  project website (if talking about your Software)
4.  at least one contact email (personal or list)

### Call For Wifi Workshops

This year, the BOSC committee will enhance the infrastructure for what
were currently labeled Birds of a Feather sessions with a wireless
router. This will allow groups to interact with software or websites
much more while they are discussing their favorite projects. The BOSC
committee will accept ideas for these up to the last day of the
conference, on a first come-first-served basis until no more space is
left in the conference room.

### Lets Create an OBF Software CD!

This year we will be devoting a small BOSC session to the task of laying
the groundwork for the creation and management of a single CD of OBF
applications, libraries for easy installation. The goal is to start the
process create a CD to distribute for the next BOSC.

### Call for Volunteers

The BOSC Organizing Committee would like to invite attendees to take a
more active role in making BOSC a successful conference by volunteering
your services. The following opportunities for assistance exist:

-   Set up, Clean up: Volunteers are needed to help set up and clean up
    any aspects of the conference room that are not done by the
    conference organizers.
-   Historian/Photographers: Volunteers are needed to help record
    aspects about BOSC 2007 for future reference. Possibilities include
    blogging the conference, writing up a review article for the
    ISCB, etc.. The Photographer will take digital photographs of all
    speakers, recording each speakers name with their image name for
    easy inclusion on the BOSC summary website after the conference.
