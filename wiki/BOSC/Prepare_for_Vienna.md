title: BOSC/Prepare for Vienna
---

This page has been set up to provide a forum for discussion regarding
the planning of BOSC 2007.

BOSC Mandate:

1.  Provide a forum for Open Source Bioinformatics Developers to meet
    and network to discuss current projects, and possibly hatch new
    projects based on percieved needs within the developer community.
2.  Provide a forum for users of Open Source Software to interact with,
    or even get involved with the developer community.
3.  Educate the research community on the value and need for Open
    Source Software.

To this end, the BOSC conference must endeavor to meet these goals using
the 16 hours of time that we are alloted during the two day ISMB SIG.
Some suggestions that I have recieved for how to do this are:

1.  Create separate sessions for different categories of talks. These
    should include, but not be limited to, a section for project updates
    by the developers of various projects. Define better requirements
    for acceptance of submission to each of the talk sessions, and
    communicate these requirements in the call for speakers.
2.  Shorten the talk times, to allow more time for discussion
    and questions.
3.  Expand on the idea of the keynote speaker. Create a special session
    for invited speakers. Call for greater involvement from the Open
    Source Developer community to decide which areas to concentrate on,
    and which experts to invite.
4.  Organize a forum for informal, relaxed discussion and socializing
    among BOSC attendees, such as a dinner or visit to a local pub after
    the days activities.
5.  Organize a forum for inter-SIG collaboration. Possibly create a slot
    to allow someone from the other SIGs to present needs, ideas to the
    Open Source Community, while also supporting the export of our own
    ideas to their SIGs.

Comments/questions to consider:

1.  How do we facilitate the integration of disperate communities, or at
    least avoid excessive fragmentation. Suppose we create separate
    sessions for, say, Project Updates, and Emerging Informatics. What
    is going to prevent the developers from choosing to skip the
    Emerging Informatics session because they dont get anything out of
    it? Isn't one goal of BOSC to provide a forum for the discussion of
    new areas where Bioinformatics Infrastructure, especially Open
    Source Infrastructure, is needed? Remember that it is perfectly
    acceptable for people to wander from SIG to SIG with the price of
    their admission. They are not a captive audience.
2.  In relation to the above, how do we prevent one community from
    completely taking over the conference for their own purposes?
3.  How do we ensure that BOSC stays relevant to the wider ISMB-SIG
    audience? Is this important?
