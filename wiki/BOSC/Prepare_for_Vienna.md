title: BOSC/Prepare for Vienna
---

This page has been set up to provide a forum for discussion regarding
the planning of BOSC 2007.

BOSC Mandate:

1.  provide developers with a forum for displaying the results of their
    development efforts to the wider research community;
2.  provide a focused environment for developers and users to interact
    and share ideas about software development, and practical techniques
    in bioinformatics;
3.  Inform the Research Community of important developments occuring
    within the Open Source Bioinformatics Developer community.

To this end, the BOSC conference must endeavor to meet these goals using
the 16 hours of time that we are alloted during the two day ISMB SIG.

Comments/questions to consider:

1.  How do we facilitate the integration of disperate communities, or at
    least avoid excessive fragmentation. Suppose we create separate
    sessions for, say, Project Updates, and Emerging Informatics. What
    is going to prevent the developers from choosing to skip the
    Emerging Informatics session because they dont get anything out of
    it? Isn't one goal of BOSC to provide a forum for the discussion of
    new areas where Bioinformatics Infrastructure, especially Open
    Source Infrastructure, is needed? Remember that it is perfectly
    acceptable for people to wander from SIG to SIG with the price of
    their admission. They are not a captive audience.
2.  In relation to the above, how do we prevent one community from
    completely taking over the conference for their own purposes?
3.  How do we ensure that BOSC stays relevant to the wider ISMB-SIG
    audience? Is this important?

ideas
-----

1.  Create separate sessions for different categories of talks. These
    should include, but not be limited to, a section for project updates
    by the developers of various projects. Define better requirements
    for acceptance of submission to each of the talk sessions, and
    communicate these requirements in the call for speakers.
2.  Shorten the talk times, to allow more time for discussion
    and questions.
3.  Expand on the idea of the keynote speaker. Create a special session
    for invited speakers. Call for greater involvement from the Open
    Source Developer community to decide which areas to concentrate on,
    and which experts to invite.
4.  Organize a forum for informal, relaxed discussion and socializing
    among BOSC attendees, such as a dinner or visit to a local pub after
    the days activities.
5.  Organize a forum for inter-SIG collaboration. Possibly create a slot
    to allow someone from the other SIGs to present needs, ideas to the
    Open Source Community, while also supporting the export of our own
    ideas to their SIGs.
6.  Create A Developer Challenge Forum. The year before BOSC (possibly
    at the end of each BOSC), teams of developers would be called on to
    submit a proposal for the development of a significant
    software product. Each team would be given a wiki on the upcoming
    BOSC 2XXX wiki site where they would communicate significant
    problems, resolutions, and achievements. At BOSC, there could be a
    session where these teams present the results of their work. If we
    had outside funding, we might be able to award travel fellowships to
    the team voted to have done the best work by the BOSC community, but
    we might need other criteria to be met before they could be entered
    into the competition?
