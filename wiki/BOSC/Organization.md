Organizational Year
-------------------

-   Early to mid December: the SIG proposal is due to the ISCB (see the
    BOSC 2007 page for example dates, etc.). Provisional acceptance is
    announced by early January. At the BOSC 2007 Post-Mortem, it was
    resolved that the ISCB would make the SIG review process more
    transparent, e.g. publish the names of the review board, and a
    formal definitiion of review requirements.
-   Early to mid December: Organize the BOSC organizing committee, and
    Abstract Review Board (these may overlap, but may not be the same).
-   Late December: Create the Official BOSC Website. This should contain
    information on keynotes, ISMB registration dates and fees, and all
    requirements for submission of abstracts, lightning talks, demos, or
    whatever venues are included in the upcoming conference, including
    the important requirements for open source licensing of all
    software, etc. It should also contain links to:
    -   The Official ISMB site for the year
    -   The Opensource.org website, and official list of licenses pages
-   Imediately after the BOSC website is made public: Announce and call
    for abstracts/lightning talks/etc. This should be This should be
    emailed out to all of the O|B|F mailing-lists. Recently I have just
    included a general statement, and a link to the Official OBF website
    for more information, instead of replicating what is in the site. I
    have always attempted to mail to multiple lists for the same O|B|F
    project, e.g. dev and announce, if it was possible. Each project has
    a mailman interface which you can find by appending the name of the
    list to <http://bioperl.org/mailman/admindb/>. You must get the
    password from Chris Dagdigian. This is useful for you to go in and
    'allow' any BOSC announcements to these lists which get held in the
    moderator que when you are not a member of the list. Other lists
    will reject it outright, but you can respond to the reject email
    with a plea for help, and it will generally get taken care of by the
    official mailing list admin. The list of recipients can be expanded
    as needed.
