BOSC Organization Overview
==========================

ISCB Contacts
-------------

-   Steven Leard: Stevem os the main liason between the BOSC Organizing
    committee, and the ISCB. He is actually not a member of the ISCB,
    but is contracted to be the liason. You can email him at any time
    with any question, and he will be able to get you the information,
    regardless of what it is. He is also the main contact for resolving
    financial reimbursements, etc. email: stevenleard@shaw.ca
-   Hershel Safer: I am not really sure what is role is, or whether he
    works for Steven or ISCB. He will email you for some things, and he
    will attend the SIG Coordinators Post-Mortem Meeting. email:
    hsafer@alum.mit.edu
-   BJ Morrison McKay: Executive Officer of ISCB. She will attend the
    Post-Mortem as well. email: admin@iscb.org

Organizational Year
-------------------

-   Early to mid November?: Organize the BOSC organizing committee, and
    Abstract Review Board (these may overlap, but may not be the same).
    Start working out keynotes and other invited speakers, full talk
    venues, panels, etc. Invite keynotes and other invited speakers. It
    would be best to have something tentative from them before the SIG
    proposal is due.
-   Early to mid December: the SIG proposal is due to the ISCB (see the
    BOSC 2007 page for example dates, etc.). Provisional acceptance is
    announced by early January. At the BOSC 2007 Post-Mortem, it was
    resolved that the ISCB would make the SIG review process more
    transparent, e.g. publish the names of the review board, and a
    formal definitiion of review requirements.
-   Late December: Create the Official BOSC Website. This should contain
    information on keynotes, ISMB registration dates and fees, and all
    requirements for submission of abstracts, lightning talks, demos, or
    whatever venues are included in the upcoming conference, including
    the important requirements for open source licensing of all
    software, etc. It is a good idea to try to announce the results of
    reviewed proposals at least 1 week before the ISMB early
    registration discount deadline, so that those who are accepted will
    be able to register with the discount, if they need. Also, it gives
    those who submit proposals for software that isnt properly
    licesensed the chance to prove that they are licensed properly
    before the deadline. Somewhere in the page there should also be
    links to:
    -   The Official ISMB site for the year
    -   The ISMB Online Registration Link (when it is made available)
    -   The Opensource.org website, and official list of licenses pages
-   Imediately after the BOSC website is made public: Announce and call
    for abstracts/lightning-talks/etc. This should be This should be
    emailed out to all of the O|B|F mailing-lists. Recently I have just
    included a general statement, and a link to the Official OBF website
    for more information, instead of replicating what is in the site. I
    have always attempted to mail to multiple lists for the same O|B|F
    project, e.g. dev and announce, if it was possible. Each project has
    a mailman interface which you can find by appending the name of the
    list to <http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/admin/>. You must get the
    password from Chris Dagdigian. This is useful for you to go in and
    'allow' any BOSC announcements to these lists which get held in the
    moderator que when you are not a member of the list. Other lists
    will reject it outright, but you can respond to the reject email
    with a plea for help, and it will generally get taken care of by the
    official mailing list admin. The list of recipients can be expanded
    as needed. I have also set up the following (email me for the
    eventful.com 'bosc' user's password):
    -   [BOSC Eventful
        Group](http://eventful.com/groups/G0-001-000014747-0) : This
        site provides an ICAL feed which will include all deadlines
        associated with BOSC 2007  
    -   [BOSC Announcement Blog](http://www.open-bio.org/boscblog/) :
        This Blog will contain all Important BOSC announcements. You can
        include it in any RSS Reader.
-   Second Call For Papers: This is to be done at least 2 weeks before
    the deadline.
-   Review Submitted Proposals: This is done via email. Those on the
    review panel should discuss a ratings procedure (preferably before
    the deadline, although this hasnt happened in the past), and all
    proposals should be subjected to this procedure. Someone should
    collate the results, and notify the submitters according to whether
    they were accepted, accepted as a lightning talk, or rejected.
-   Submit pdf file for printed ISMB BOSC material to be handed out.
    There is a Docbook formated document that I have been using to
    create this using docbook2pdf. These are available from
    <http://people.genome.duke.edu/~londo003/bosc2007/program>.
-   Send out a reminder that we are still accepting lightning talks,
    and wifi-workshops.
-   Run the conference.
-   After the conference, there will be a meeting between the ISMB and
    SIG coordinators, usually Sunday or Monday. On some years, they have
    wanted the SIGs to present something to the ISMB attendees about
    the SIG.
-   Meet with OBF board to discuss future plans.
