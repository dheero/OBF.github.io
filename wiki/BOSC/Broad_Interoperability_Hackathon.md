title: BOSC/Broad Interoperability Hackathon
---

The BOSC/Broad interoperability hackathon will take place Sunday and
Monday, April 7th and 8th at the [Broad
Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
It occurs just prior to [Bio-IT World](http://www.bio-itworldexpo.com/)
in Boston and is a warm up event for \[BOSC 2013\] occurring July
17-20th in Berlin. Everyone is welcome, and we'll have more details soon
along with an official webpage.

Goals
-----

The goal of this hackathon will be developing open source tools to help
enhance bioinformatics interoperability. Building flexible, reproducible
workflows with connected best-practice tools is essential to modern
biological programming. Tools generated by the open source scientific
community help drive innovative research and discoveries. The goal of
these two days is to investigate how we can increase tool connectivity
and help communities work better together.

Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org) auditorium at [7 Cambridge
