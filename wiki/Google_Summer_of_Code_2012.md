GSoC 2012
---------

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation has been accepted as a mentoring
organization for Google Summer of Code 2012, with 5 student projects
funded!

2012 Student Projects
---------------------

### Wibowo Arindrarto

  
[SearchIO Implementation in Biopython](http://bow.web.id/blog/tag/gsoc/)

mentored by Peter Cock

Bow continues to develop and maintain the SearchIO module, the product
of his GSoC work, and contributes to other areas of Biopython as well.

### Lenna Peterson

  
[Diff My DNA: Development of a Genomic Variant Toolkit for
BioPython](http://arklenna.tumblr.com/tagged/gsoc2012)

mentored by Brad Chapman

Lenna continues to actively contribute to several parts of Biopython.

### Marjan Povolni

  
[The world's fastest parallelized GFF3/GTF parser in D, and an
interfacing biogem plugin for
Ruby](http://blog.mpthecoder.com/tagged/gsoc)

mentored by Pjotr Prins, Francesco Strozzi, Raoul Bonnal

Marjan is still actively developing in FOSS, and also contributes to
[biogems.info](http://www.biogems.info/).

*An interview with Marjan*

**You participated in OBF/GSoC, what did it bring you in your current
pursuits?**

It connected me to experienced people who helped me to into science.

**What projects did you work on and are they still in use?**

My project was about parsing the GFF3 textual format used in
bioinformatics, but at the same time increasing the speed and reducing
the memory footprint of the parser manyfold. I don't believe the project
is used by many people right now. However, I do think it has potential
to be integrated into data processing pipelines. Since GSoC 2012 ended I
didn't have the time to keep working on it, but I'm still positive it
will change very soon and I'll continue working on it.

**Are you still involved with these projects or elsewhere in FOSS?**

My schedule currently doesn't allow it, but I'm positive that will
change very soon, I would like to continue working on the project and
related themes.

**Did you enjoy OBF/GSoC and do you have any special memories?**

I did, working from home is great and challenges suit me well. I also
had the fortune to meet some of the people behind OBF at a codefest that
was organized nearby. Releasing the first development version of the
code was a feeling that cannot be described in words, and the feedback I
received made me feel I had accomplished something, even though I had
work experience before.

**Was the OBF/GSoC organisation good for you? What stood out?**

Yes, it was very good. What I liked most were the weekly hangouts with
the other accepted students and mentors. I was working on the project
myself, but never felt alone.

**Would you recommend OBF/GSoC to other students and do you have any
hints for them?**

Definitely. Bioinformatics is a great place to be right now, there is
already so much that has been discovered, but that's only the tip of the
iceberg. And going forward the field of biology can advance only with
the help from bioinformatics.

### Artem Tarasov

  
[Robust and fast parallel BAM parser in D for binding against dynamic
languages](http://lomereiter.wordpress.com/tag/gsoc)

mentored by Pjotr Prins, Francesco Strozzi, Raoul Bonnal

*An interview with Artem*

**You participated in OBF/GSoC, what did it bring you in your
pursuits?**

GSoC gave me experience of collaborative open-source development, and
OBF introduced me to the bioinformatics field.

**What projects did you work on and are they still in use?**

I worked on a new library for working with SAM/BAM files; it is now used
by a few people but we aim to attract more by publishing a paper soon.

**Are you still involved with these projects or elsewhere in FOSS?**

Yes, the development has been continuing after GSoC, and quite a lot of
new functionality has been added.

**Did you enjoy OBF/GSoC and do you have any special memories?**

I enjoyed GSoC a lot. It was wonderful to realise how geographically
diverse the OBF community is.

**Was the OBF/GSoC organisation good for you? What stood out?**

The community was very helpful and friendly. With respect to
programming, they encouraged students to do thorough testing and write
proper documentation. Plus, we had a few rounds of code reviews.

**Would you recommend OBF/GSoC to other students and do you have any
hints for them?**

Yes, definitely! It is a good opportunity to learn a bit about
bioinformatics and to practice some agile software development
approaches.

### Clayton Wheeler

  
[Multiple Alignment Format parser for
BioRuby](http://csw.github.com/bioruby-maf/)

mentored by Francesco Strozzi and Raoul Bonnal

*Note to students: project ideas on the wikis of member projects are
only selected projects, albeit well thought-out ones. You are encouraged
to propose your own project, just make sure it is still a contribution
to one the OBF member projects (see list below)! If we like your
proposal, we will try to find a mentor to help you with the project.
Regardless of what you decide to do, make sure you read and follow the
guidelines for students below.*
