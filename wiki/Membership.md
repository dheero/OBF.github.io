Membership application
----------------------

The OBF is actively inviting professionals, scientists, students, and
others active in the Open Source Software arena in the life sciences to
join the OBF as a member. The membership body was formally established
at the [2005 Board of Directors](Minutes:2005_BOSC_Meeting "wikilink")
meeting. As laid out in the [OBF
Bylaws](http://news.open-bio.org/archives/uploads/OBF-Election-Bylaws-1.pdf),
officers in the Board of Directors will be elected by the membership
among nominees, and candidates for future Directors will be nominated
from the membership when seats are added or a term expires.

The eligibility criteria are met by anyone who is "interested in the
objectives of the OBF", and there are no dues at present. You can join
throughout the year by filling out the [application
form](:Image:OBF_Membership_Form.pdf "wikilink"), signing it, and either
mailing it to the OBF or emailing a scan to the
[Parliamentarian](bp:Hilmar_Lapp "wikilink"). The best time and place to
join though is at the annual BOSC conference, because attendees are
automatically deemed eligible based on the fact that they attend BOSC,
and forms may just be dropped off at a designated place or with any
Board member.

### Participate in OBF's Future

The Board established the membership body as the platform from which
major future changes to the OBF's mission, agenda, and scope will
originate, through active participation, discussion, and possibly most
importantly, through providing the future leadership of the OBF. If you
have ideas and the energy to advocate them then we encourage you to join
as a member if you haven't already, and to step up and nominate yourself
for future elections to the Board. The bylaws also define terms for
Directors as well as Officers, so seats will come up for election every
year.
