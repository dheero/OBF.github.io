title: Google Summer of Code 2015 Ideas
---

The details of each of our project ideas are listed below, including
potential mentors. Interested mentors and students should subscribe to
the OBF/GSoC [mailing
list](http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc) and announce
their interest.

See the main OBF [Google Summer of
Code](Google_Summer_of_Code "wikilink") page for more information about
the GSoC program and additional ways to get in touch with us.

Cross-project ideas
-------------------

OBF is an umbrella organization which represents many different
programming languages used in
[bioinformatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics). In
addition to working with each of the "Bio\*" projects (listed below),
this year we are also accepting a category of "cross-project" ideas that
cover multiple programming languages or projects. These collaborative
ideas are broadly defined and can be thought of as "unfinished" â€”
interested students should adapt the ideas to their own strengths and
goals, and are responsible for the quality of the final proposed idea in
their application.

**Feel free to propose your own entirely new idea**. You can also draw
ideas from [Genome Informatics
(GMOD)](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSoC#2014_Project_Ideas) and the [National
Evolutionary Synthesis Center
(NESCent)](http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2014).

### Nextflow graphical front-end

Rationale  
Nextflow is a data-driven toolkit for computational pipelines that
simplify writing parallel and scalable pipelines in a portable manner.
Its goal is to make data analysis required by next generation sequence
technologies and, in more general terms, bioinformatics applications
easier for researchers. You can read more about Nextflow at this
link (http://www.nextflow.io).

<!-- -->

  
It follows the UNIX philosophy where many small tools can be composed
together to create efficient computational solutions where individual
parts can be easily replaced. It has been designed to allow developers
to fast prototype applications reusing their existing tools and scripts.
For this reason it has been developed primarily as a command line
oriented tool. However, complex pipelines may benefit from having a
visualisation layer that helps the developer design and represent the
application workflow logic.

<!-- -->

  
NoFlo-UI is the presentation layer for NoFlo, a flow-based
programming (FBP) environment that makes software creation more
accessible and collaborative. It provides an interactive interface which
allows you to create a computational workflow by dragging, dropping and
connecting the different task components. It basically allows you to
"draw" an application in such a way that it resembles a subway map. This
"map" can then be more easily understood, shared and curated by other
developers, compared to managing endless files of source code.

<!-- -->

Approach  
The goal, therefore, of the this proposal is to implement a graphical
front-end, based on the NoFlo-UI project, for the Nextflow
programming environment. This would provide the latter with a
presentation layer that would allow scientists to "sketch" their
computational pipelines instead of programming them, making it easier to
share and handle complex task interactions in their application logic.

<!-- -->

  
Ideally this integration will implement a two-way tool in such a way
that changes, applied in the visual editor, are reflected in the
Nextflow scripting language and vice-versa.

<!-- -->

Languages and skills  
The student is required to have proven working ability with Javascript,
HTML5, Polymer and Node.js for the front-end development and good level
of knowledge of the Groovy/Java programming languages for Nextflow side.

<!-- -->

  
He/she may also benefit by having some theoretical and practical
knowledge of programming language syntax and grammar parsers.

<!-- -->

Code  
Nextflow source code is available at the following
repository (https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/)

NoFlo-UI source code is available at this
link (https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui/)

### Nextflow low latency scheduling and in-memory data processing

Rationale  
Nextflow is a data-driven toolkit for computational pipelines that
simplify writing parallel and scalable pipelines in a portable manner
across different execution platforms. Its goal is to make data analysis
required by next generation sequence technologies and, in more general
terms, bioinformatics applications easier for researchers.

<!-- -->

  
Nextflow does not implement a task scheduling strategy on its own but
delegates it to the underlying processing infrastructure, which in most
cases is a grid engine like technology (SGE, PBS, SLURM, etc). However,
these platforms were designed for job processing in a batch scheduling
fashion, i.e. a few long duration jobs scheduled sequentially to the
computer-cluster facility. This model suffers from very high latencies
which make it unfit for highly parallel and short-lived jobs that are
more and more common in bioinformatics data analysis.

<!-- -->

  
The goal of this proposal is to integrate the Sparrow scheduler and
Tachyon in-memory file system with Nextflow to overcome the limitations
of batch-like schedulers generally available in most common cluster
computation facilities.

<!-- -->

  
The first is a high throughput, low latency distributed cluster
scheduler, while the second is a memory centric distributed file system.
Both of them are open source research projects developed at UC Berkeley.

<!-- -->

  
The integration of these technologies would allow Nextflow to manage
large distributed workloads in a more efficient and timely manner and to
decrease the task granularity in Nextflow pipelines. Thus gaining an
higher parallelism degree and better applications performance.

<!-- -->

Approach  
Nextflow implements an extensible mechanism that allows it to support
several computing platforms and file systems in a portable manner.

The approach suggested consists in implementing a new Nextflow executor
which integrates the Sparrow scheduler and its features.

The support for Tachyon file system can be added to Nextflow by writing
an adapter layer that follows the Java JSR-203 specification.

<!-- -->

Languages and skills  
Student is required to have proven working ability with the Java and/or
Groovy programming languages and a good level of theoretical and
practical knowledge in parallel and concurrent programming.

### Create GNU Guix Bioinformatics packaging system and add support to CloudBiolinux

Rationale  
[GNU Guix](http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/) is a next generation
software packaging system that has many interesting

features for bioinformatics including multi-version support,
transactional installs and reproducible systems.

GNU GUix is written in the Scheme/LISP programming language and works
well with

virtual machines and Docker, for example.

Currently CloudBiolinux depends on linuxbrew/homebrew for creating
special packages.

We propose to replace part of the linuxbrew infrastructure with that of
GNU Guix.

Having the GNU Guix bionformatics package will allow us to run exactly

the same software on workstations, servers and virtual machines.

<!-- -->

Approach  
Write in Scheme a new collection of bioinformatics packages for GNU Guix
as part of the GNU

project, perhaps adding further support for Ruby and Python interpreters
in the process

(Python is rather well supported already). Embed GNU Guix inside
CloudBiolinux by

using 'flavors'. Also

write a testing infrastructure in Python. Next introduce GNU Guix to
Galaxy as part

of the Galaxy toolshed.

<!-- -->

Languages and skills  
Interest in reproducible software deployment for bioinformatics. Willing
to learn Scheme, some command of Python.

<!-- -->

For GSoC 2014, BioJava is partnering with the Systems Biology Markup
Language (SMBL) team to bring enhancements to JSBML, the standard Java
implementation of SBML, and bring SBML features to other Java-based
systems biology software. See [the SMBL
website](http://sbml.org/GSoC2014) for more ideas from the SBML team.

Students working on these projects will interact with both the BioJava
and JSBML communities, which overlap. Most development will happen on
the JSBML codebase, although BioJava is used as a supporting library for
some components.

### Add local realignment support to Sambamba

Rationale  
Sambamba is a multi-core alignment processor for next generation
sequencing

(BAM/SAM/CRAM formats). It mostly replaces the samtools software apart
from

the mpileup routine. To achieve that the local realignment routine of

samtools needs to be implemented in the D programming language,
preferably removing the bugs and

taking ideas from the freebayes local realignment implementation.

<!-- -->

Approach  
Implement a local realignment routine in D. Add mpileup support
to sambamaba.

Update the bioruby-samtools package to support sambamba.

<!-- -->

Languages and skill  
Able to read C code and willing to write high-performance software in D
(and some Ruby).

Basic understanding of probability theory

[BioHaskell](http://biohaskell.org/Google_Summer_of_Code)
---------------------------------------------------------

:\* [Project website](http://biohaskell.org/)

:\* [Bioinformatics section on
HackageDB](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/#cat:Bioinformatics)

:\* [GSoC page](http://biohaskell.org/Google_Summer_of_Code)

Biohaskell has its own gsoc page. We currently have 2 (+1) open problems
listed there. In addition, we accept peoples' own ideas and have a
number of open problems not listed. The latter fall somewhere between
bachelors thesis and PhD work and are harder to nicely package up.

### Fast k-mer indexing

Rationale  
Fast k-mer indexing requires a data structure mapping a short string of
k characters to a value. While trivial to do with almost all key-value
maps, we also require a very memory-efficient storage system. Knowledge
of suffix structures is a definite plus.

<!-- -->

Approach  
Determine feasibility of implementation in pure Haskell vs. binding to
new or existing C code. Multi-threadedness will pose a problem. There is
currently no efficient suffix tree implementation available in Haskell
(lazy suffix trees do exist but are efficient only under
certain conditions).

<!-- -->

Languages and skill  
Haskell, maybe C (low-level code). Skill: need to have worked with
suffix structures before GSoC starts. If in coded in C, then enough
Haskell knowledge to be able to create thread-safe bindings. Otherwise,
medium to advanced Haskell knowledge.

<!-- -->

Code  
[containers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers) and
[unordered
containers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unordered-containers) for
references to map-like container structures.

### Low-level bit and stream-fusion optimizations

Rationale  
In Haskell, we typically don't talk that much about low-level
implementation details. For some algorithms, low-level details
(especially bitwise operations and SIMD instructions) become important.
I have a library dealing with bitsets but it is not yet fully efficient.
Getting SIMD instructions to play nice with /generic/ dynamic
programming recursion schemes is probably really hard.

<!-- -->

Approach  
Write benchmarking code for the different bit-manipulating functions.
Optimize the code to be as loopless as possible. Allow for
architecture-dependend code rewrites. The SIMD question is rather
open-ended and could very well be a Haskell.org task.

<!-- -->

Languages and skill  
Haskell and C. Bitset operations require knowledge of specialized
C routines. Including IFDef-ing for different architectures. Code should
be as non-branching / non-recursive as possible. SIMD instructions have
been added to vector library. The problem we face is that vector-SIMD
code expects data to be ordered linearly. Dynamic programming code leads
to unordered access structures. The student should know about the Core
language (one of the intermediate languages between Haskell and the
final binary).

<!-- -->

Code  
[vector](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector) for streaming code.
[bits](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bits) for some
bitwise operations. An Ordered-Bits library will be pushed to hackage
next week with reference code. Dynamic programming code requires
[primitive arrays](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/PrimitiveArray)
and [ADPfusion](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ADPfusion).
