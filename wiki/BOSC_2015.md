Survey about BOSC 2015 location
-------------------------------

We have asked you, and you have spoken! 59 past and/or future BOSC
attendees participated in our survey, answering questions about what
they liked at BOSC 2014, what changes they’d like to see, and—most
importantly—what they thought about the proposal to possibly hold BOSC
2015 in Norwich (UK) just after the Galaxy Community Conference, rather
than as an ISMB SIG. Although some survey participants indicated that
they would be more likely to attend BOSC 2015 if it were co-located with
GCC, the majority prefer BOSC to remain an ISMB SIG, so we will hold
BOSC 2015 in Dublin on 10-11 July, 2015, right before ISMB 2015.

Although the survey is now closed, we are always happy to hear your
suggestions for BOSC 2015. (We are particularly interested in increasing
diversity at BOSC, and welcome suggestions of people to invite.) You can
reach us at bosc@open-bio.org.
