== Overview ==
The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. 

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination, and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming together of the open source developer community in one location to meet face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies.  In short, BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly apply to their own work.

== Keynote Speakers ==

The BOSC 2009 Organizing committee is pleased to announce our two Keynote Speakers:

=== Alan Ruttenberg ===

[http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/ruttenberg/ Alan Ruttenberg] is a Principal Scientist at [http://sciencecommons.org Science Commons].  He works with Semantic Web technologies in computational biology, with an emphasis on the creation and application of structured biological knowledge to interpret experimental results. He is currently involved in a number of open biomedical ontology efforts, including: the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) that will form the upper level ontology for the OBO foundry, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO), the Program on Ontologies of Neural Structures (PONS), the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), and BioPAX-OBO for representing molecular and cellular pathways. These interests and efforts come together in my project at Science Commons - the Neurocommons, a large scale Semantic Web knowledge base of biological information aimed at supporting, initially, the neurosciences. He is also an active participant in W3C Semantic Web activities. In 2006 and 2007 he was a member of the Health Care Life Sciences Interest Group, and early work on the Neurocommons became the core of the prototype life sciences knowledge base that the group has documented. He is a chair of the OWL Working Group specifying OWL 2, and a coordinating editor of the OBO Foundry. 
His graduate work was at the MIT Media Lab in the Music and Cognition Group, and he has an undergraduate degree in Physics and Mathematics from Brandeis University.

His talk at BOSC will be entitled "Can we reduce the burden of data integration?  Challenge and opportunity in building the web of data".

=== Robert S. Hanmer ===

Robert S. Hanmer is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff in the Technical Component Management area in Alcatel-Lucent’s Operations area.  He is based in Naperville, Illinois, USA. Current responsibilities include developing software-sourcing strategies for middleware and open source software. Previous positions within Lucent and Bell Laboratories have included development, architecture and evaluation of highly reliable systems focusing especially on the areas of reliability and performance.  He is active in the software patterns community, including serving as program chair at several pattern conferences.  He has authored or co-authored 14 journal articles, several book chapters and the book Patterns for Fault Tolerant Software. He is a member of the IEEE Computer Society,  a Senior Member of the ACM and current President of [http://hillside.net/ The Hillside Group], the organization that sponsors the PLoP conference.  He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

His talk at BOSC will be entitled "Software Patterns for Reusable Design".

** Windows XP Professional (English)
** Microsoft Office 2007 Professional (English)
** Adobe Reader 8
** Internet connection
* For maximum flexibility, please save your file as a .pdf or .ppt (not .pptx)
* Live demos are possible, but we advise that you also bring screen shots.  While we have been promised an internet connection, be prepared for connection problems.

=== Post-conference Slide Availability ===

* In the spirit of openness, we would like to make the presentation slides publicly available after the conference.
* The organizers will be requesting an electronic copy of the slides for posting.
* For example, see slides from BOSC 2008 on [http://www.slideshare.net/tag/bosc_2008 SlideShare].

== Call for Lightning Talks/Demos/Birds of a Feather Sessions ==

=== Lightning Talks and Software Demonstrations ===

The program committee is currently seeking speakers for the lightning talks. Lightning talks are quick - only five minutes long - and a great opportunity for you to give people a quick summary of your open source project, code, idea, or vision of the future.  Or, if you are involved in the development of novel Open Source Software, you could use the time to give a quick demonstration of your work.

If you are interested in giving a Lightning Talk or Software Demonstration at BOSC 2009, please e-mail us at [mailto:bosc@open-bio.org bosc@open-bio.org]:
* a brief title and summary (one or two lines)
* a URL for the project page, if applicable
* the specific open source license used for your software or your release plans (NOTE: the [[BOSC_2009#Open_Source_License_Requirement | Open Source License Requirement]] also applies to Lightning talks).

We will accept entries on-line until BOSC starts, but space for demos and lightning talks is limited.

=== Birds of a Feather Sessions ===

One of the more popular activities at BOSC are the Birds-of-a-Feather sub-meetings that people organize at the end of each days session.  These are free-form meetings organized by the attendees themselves.  Traditionally, some BOF's have been formed to allow developers and users of individual [[OBF]] software to meet each other face-to-face to discuss the project, but other meetings have been formed to discuss completely new ideas.  These meetings offer a unique opportunity for individuals to explore more about the activities of the various Open Source Projects, and, in some cases, even take an active role influencing the future of Open Source Software development.  If you would like to create a BOF, just sign up for a [[Special:Userlogin| wiki account]], login, and edit the [[BOSC_2009/Birds-of-a-Feather | BOSC 2009 Birds of a Feather]] page.


== Sessions ==

This year’s conference will mark the 10th anniversary of BOSC.  To celebrate the special occasion, the theme of this year’s conference is “Looking Back and Looking Ahead:  Open Source Solutions to Grand Challenges in Bioinformatics.”

Ware asking all speakers to come prepared to lead an informal tutorial on their software during a Birds of a Feather/hackathon session.  This year’s topics include:
* '''Design Patterns in Bioinformatics''' (topic organizer: [http://www.ohio.edu/cidds/welch/ Lonnie Welch])
** Various recurring patterns have emerged in the field of bioinformatics.  The open source community has created many of these patterns, and this session will feature presentations that analyze and codify bioinformatics patterns.  See http://hillside.net/patterns/ for definitions and examples of patterns.   
* '''Regulatory Genomics''' (topic organizer: [http://www.ohio.edu/cidds/welch/ Lonnie Welch])
** This session will focus on open source software that is designed for decoding the regulatory aspects, i.e., the control systems, of the genomes.   
* '''Multicore and GPGPU computing''' (topic organizer: [http://frankdrews.com/ Frank Drews])
* '''Data & Analysis Management''' (topic organizer: [http://www.bx.psu.edu/~anton/ Anton Nekrutenko])
** Shared session with [http://www.dam-sig.org/ DAM SIG] for introduction of cutting edge applications that mold data sources and analysis tools into a singular medium benefitting both extremes on the user spectrum: experimentalists and computational researchers
* '''Computational Grids''' (topic organizers: [http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/mitarbeiter/moeller/ Steffen M&ouml;ller], [http://frankdrews.com/ Frank Drews])
** Presentation of projects in computational biology that adapted grid technologies for their research or services. The speaker should explain how heterogeneous resources from multiple geographical locations were brought together to achieve what barely could have been achieved alone.
* '''Visualization''' (topic organizers: [http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk Jim Procter])
* '''Bio* Updates''' 
** Updates from O|B|F-sponsored projects
* '''Open Source Software'''
** Open source software that does not fit neatly into the above categories.  
* '''Lightning Talks''' will also highlight very recent developments.
