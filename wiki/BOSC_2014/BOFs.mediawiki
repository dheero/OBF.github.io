If you would like to organize a Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting at BOSC 2014, please sign up for a [[Special:Userlogin| wiki account]], log in, and add your BOF description to this page. Please list the BOF topic and the name of the organizer.

The BOFs can either be over lunch (which can be very busy with other events), or start after the end of the last talk (around 5:30) and run until 6:30 or until you're kicked out of the room.

There can be multiple BOFs in parallel.

== Friday BOFs (Day 1) ==

* '''Lunchtime (12:30-14:00)'''
** (Enter your BOF description here)
* '''17:30-18:30'''
** '''De-coupling BOSC from the ISMB?''' Contact Peter Cock. Try to get a feel from the attendees about who likes having BOSC as an SIG at the ISMB, versus going independent and perhaps co-locating near other broad interest meetings?

== Saturday BOFs (Day 2) ==
* '''Lunchtime (12:30-14:00)'''
** (Enter your BOF description here)
* '''17:30-18:30'''
** (Enter your BOF description here)
