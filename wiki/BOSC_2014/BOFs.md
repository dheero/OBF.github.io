title: BOSC 2014/BOFs
---

If you would like to organize a Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting at BOSC
2014, please sign up for a [ wiki
account](Special:Userlogin "wikilink"), log in, and add your BOF
description to this page. Please list the BOF topic and the name of the
organizer.

The BOFs can either be over lunch (which can be very busy with other
events), or start after the end of the last talk (around 5:30) and run
until 6:30 or until you're kicked out of the room.

There can be multiple BOFs in parallel.

Friday BOFs (Day 1)
-------------------

-   **Lunchtime (12:30-14:00)**
    -   (Enter your BOF description here)
-   **17:30-18:30**
    -   **De-coupling BOSC from the ISMB?** Contact Peter Cock. Try to
        get a feel from the attendees about who likes having BOSC as an
        SIG at the ISMB, versus going independent and perhaps
        co-locating near other broad interest meetings?

Saturday BOFs (Day 2)
---------------------

-   **Lunchtime (12:30-14:00)**
    -   **Dependent Types and Safety in Biomedical Software:** How to
        make sure that the software that will pick my treatment is doing
        what it is supposed to do? [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr/),
        [Dependent types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_types),
        [Therac-25](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25), … (proposed
        by [Seb](http://seb.mondet.org/))
-   **17:30-18:30**
    -   **Genome Visualization**: potential for cooperation? (Proposed
        by Thomas Down)
