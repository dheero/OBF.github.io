The meeting will be held via conference call. To join the conference:
* Dial +1-605-475-5950
* Participant Access Code: 279610

Note that the dial-in number is not a toll-free number. Depending on the long-distance plan on your phone, you may incur long-distance charges by dialing in. If you are based internationally, you would incur the applicable rate for calling a US phone number; alternatively, you can use call-out from within Skype, which only costs a few cents in most countries.

If you call in, please mute your phone if you aren't speaking or about to speak, to avoid feedback loops and excessive noise or static on the line. If your phone doesn't have a convenient mute feature, you can push *6 (star-6) to mute or un-mute yourself on the line.
