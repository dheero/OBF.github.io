=Genomdiff=

==Purpose==

Program to compare the RNA of two biological viruses graphically by a dotplot chart. Other RNA or DNA sequencies may also be comparable by the program but such an comparison is more time expensive. The comparison gives an overview over  bigger regions of fuzzy equality of nucleotide bases or amino acids.

==Usage==

* Comparison of two complete genomes
* Location of a piece of protein within one complete genome
* Window Zoom
* Alignment view with shift by mouse wheel

==Installation==

The program runs under all operating systems which support Java >= 1.5, among them

* WIN2K/XP/Vista
* Linux
* MAC (Middle Mouse Button not clear)

Install the Java Runtime from Sun or third party. Start the program by typing:

<b>
<pre>
java -jar pgenomdiff_2007-05-01.jar.
</pre>
</b>

Double click under WinDows may also work after installing the Java Runtime.

==Connectivity==

The program creates a property file with one last opened comparison within the users $HOME. It can connect itself to the internet. You can enter your HTTP proxy server. The parser understands ENTREZ files.
