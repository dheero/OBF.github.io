=== Posters ===
We have reserved a few spaces for walk-in posters, which must meet the BOSC requirements of open source and recognized license. The ISMB staff specify that posters should not exceed the following dimensions: 0.95 m wide x 1.30 m high.

=== Open Source Requirement ===
To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic in a talk or poster submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for download in source code form at the time they are reviewed.

The [[OBF|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], which sponsors BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software Development within the biological research community. For this reason, if a submitted abstract concerns a specific software system for use by the research community, then that software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.
