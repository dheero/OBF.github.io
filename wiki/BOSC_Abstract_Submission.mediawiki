'''[http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2013/openconf.php Submit your poster abstract here!]'''

The deadline for abstract submissions for talks was Friday, April 12, 2013. Authors who submitted talk abstracts will be notified on '''May 6'''.

BOSC includes poster sessions, and we still have openings for posters. If you want to present a poster and would like your poster abstract to be included in the BOSC program, please [http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2013/openconf.php submit it] by '''June 7'''. We will have space for some last-minute walk-in posters as well (but they will not be listed in the BOSC program).

=== Abstract Formatting Requirements ===
To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic in a presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for download in source code form at the time they are reviewed. Please see the next section for more information.

=== Posters ===
We have reserved a few spaces for walk-in posters, which must meet the BOSC requirements of open source and recognized license. The ISMB staff specify that posters should not exceed the following dimensions: 0.95 m wide x 1.30 m high.

== BOSC Open Source License Requirement ==

The [[OBF|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], which sponsors BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software Development within the biological research community. For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a specific software system for use by the research community, then that software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.
