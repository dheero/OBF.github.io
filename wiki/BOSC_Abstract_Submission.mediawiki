The deadline for abstract submissions for lightning talks and posters to be included in the BOSC program was '''Wednesday, June 4, 2014'''.  However, we still have a few spots for last-minute posters (abstracts will not appear in the program).

=== Abstract Formatting Requirements ===
Abstracts must be '''one page''' (8.5 inches by 11 inches) in length and submitted '''as a PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word file only'''.

Please format your abstract as follows:
* Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom of the page.
* Include the following pieces of information in order from the top of the page:
** Title
** Authors, with the presenting author's name underlined.
** Author affiliations, including the e-mail address of the presenting author.
** URL for the overall project web site
** URL for accessing the code
** The particular Open Source License being used
* The abstracts will be printed "as is" in the program booklet; please help your all-volunteer Organizing Committee by following the formatting guidelines above.

To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic in a presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for download in source code form. Please see the next section for more information.

== BOSC Open Source License Requirement ==

The [[OBF|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], which sponsors BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software Development within the biological research community. For this reason, if a submitted abstract concerns a specific software system for use by the research community, then that software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.
