If you would like to organize a Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting at BOSC
2012, just sign up for a [ wiki account](Special:Userlogin "wikilink"),
log in, and add your BOF description to this page. Please list the BOF
topic and the name of the organizer.

The BOFs are from ~5:30-6:30 in the same room as the BOSC talks.

Friday BOFs (Day 1)
-------------------

### HDF5 Users

Anyone interested in HDF5 or who has questions that could not be
answered during the talk is invited to talk to one of the HDF5
developers during this BOF.

### Data visualization

For people interested in chatting about tools, approaches, best
practices, unsolved issues, ... in (biological) data visualization.

Saturday BOFs (Day 2)
---------------------

### Interactive Visualizations with D3

Thought it might be interesting to go over some basics and examples of
D3 - a javascript based data visualization library. And perhaps hear how
other groups are using (or thinking about using) this tool.

### Bioinformatics Interoperability Environments

Topics of interest to developers and users of bioinformatics
interoperability environments, e.g.
[GenomeSpace](http://www.genomespace.org),
[Galaxy](http://galaxy.psu.edu/), [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk),
and others.

The myGrid team would like to discuss the interoperability of Taverna
(http://www.taverna.org.uk), myExperiment (http://www.myexperiment.org),
BioCatalogue (http://www.biocatalogue.org) with GenomeSpace and Galaxy
in particular. We would also like to add in RightField
(http://www.rightfield.org.uk) and SEEK (http://www.seek4science.org)
into the mix.
