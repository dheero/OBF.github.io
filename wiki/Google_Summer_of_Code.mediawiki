'''The OBF has been accepted into the [http://code.google.com/soc Google Summer of Code] (GSoC) program as an umbrella organization for all OBF-affiliated projects.'''

This page is the collection point for ideas, projects, prerequisites, solution approaches, mentors, other people or channels to contact for more information.

== About Google Summer of Code ==

For those not familiar with the program, Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a student internship program for open-source projects. The program offers eligible student developers stipends to write code for open source projects over a period of 3 summer months ("flip bits, not burgers").  Aside from the stipend, one of the most important features of the program is that students are paired with mentors, who are typically experienced developers from the project to which the student contributes.  The mentor guides the student to work productively within the community, and helps the student avoid obstacles and pitfalls.  The program is global - students and mentors may be located anywhere where they have internet connection (except for countries affected by US trade restrictions), and no travel is required. Thus, aside from the stipend and mentorship aspects, the student's experience in the internship closely mirrors normal work on distributed development projects.  Effective work habits for distributed development are typically not taught in computer science curricula, yet are highly desired in the increasingly global software and IT industries.

From the viewpoint of each open-source project, the program not only offers to pay students for contributing, but more importantly offers an opportunity to recruit new developers who will hopefully go on to become regular, sustained contributors.

See the [http://code.google.com/soc Main GSoC Site] for more information and FAQs, and see below for [[ #Other_Facts_.26_Links |other facts such as eligibility and timelines ]].

''Note to students: project ideas on the wikis of member projects are only selected projects, albeit well thought-out ones. You are encouraged to propose your own project, just make sure it is still a contribution to one the OBF member projects (see list below)! If we like your proposal, we will try to find a mentor to help you with the project.  Regardless of what you decide to do, make sure you read and follow the [[#What_should_prospective_students_know.3F|guidelines for students]] below.''

== Contact ==

=== IRC - Internet Relay Chat ===

IRC is the preferred method of real-time communication between GSoC participants.  OBF IRC channels are maintained on [http://freenode.net freenode], connect your IRC client to <code>chat.freenode.net</code>.

;Main OBF GSoC Channel: <code>#obf-soc</code>
;BioPerl: <code>#bioperl</code>

=== Email ===

For prospective students, the first point of contact should be the mailing list of the OBF project you are interested in working with:

;BioPerl: [mailto:bioperl-l%40lists%2eopen-bio%2eorg bioperl-l&#64;lists&#46;open-bio&#46;org]
;BioPython: [mailto:biopython%40lists%2eopen-bio%2eorg biopython&#64;lists&#46;open-bio&#46;org]
;BioJava: [mailto:biojava-l%40lists%2eopen-bio%2eorg biojava-l&#64;lists&#46;open-bio&#46;org]
;BioRuby: [mailto:bioruby%40lists%2eopen-bio%2eorg bioruby&#64;lists&#46;open-bio&#46;org]
;BioSQL: [mailto:biosql-l%40lists%2eopen-bio%2eorg biosql-l&#64;lists&#46;open-bio&#46;org]
;BioLib: [mailto:biolib-dev%40lists%2eopen-bio%2eorg biolib-dev&#64;lists&#46;open-bio&#46;org]
;BioDAS: [mailto:das@lists.open-bio.org das@lists.open-bio.org]

Also, it would be a good idea to CC the organization adminstrator, so he can make sure that you are properly taken care of:

;Organization administrator: [[User:RobertBuels|Robert Buels]] ([mailto:rmb32%40cornell%2eedu rmb32&#64;cornell&#46;edu])
;Backup administrator: [[User:Lapp|Hilmar Lapp]] ([mailto:hlapp%40gmx%2enet hlapp&#64;gmx&#46;net])

If you are not quite sure which project you would like to contribute to, you can email to the organization administrator for help.  However, do not worry overly much about picking the right OBF project at the outset.  If you are unsure, simply make your best guess, and other members of the email list will help you to find the best organization to suit your idea.

Before applying, please read our [[#What_should_prospective_students_know.3F|documentation on information that students should know and guidelines we expect you to follow]]. We also require that you include certain information, listed below, under "[[#When you apply|When you apply]]."

Some mentors and developers can regularly be found on IRC, see the list of OBF projects below for information on which projects have a channel and the name of the channel. And/or join <code>#obf-soc</code> on [http://freenode.net Freenode.] ''(If you do not have an IRC client installed, you might find the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IRC_clients comparison on Wikipedia], the [http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Chat/IRC/ Google directory], or the [http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/ IRC Reviews] helpful. For Macs, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Chat X-Chat Aqua] works pretty well. If you have never used IRC, try the [http://irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html IRC Primer] at [http://irchelp.org/ IRC Help], which also has links to lots of other material.)''

== Guide for prospective GSoC students ==

=== Before you apply ===

* Proposals should extend one of affiliated toolkits, not start a new project.
* If you want to apply with your own idea, try to [[#Contact|contact us]] early on so we can work with you to find a mentor and solidify your project idea and application.
* [[#Contact|Ask us questions]] about the project idea you have in mind.
* Write a project proposal draft, include a project plan (see below), and [[#Contact|bounce those off of us]].

Again, '''students are strongly encouraged to [[#Contact|contact us]] as early as possible'''. Frequent and early communication is extremely valuable for putting together successful projects.

=== When you apply ===

When applying, (aside from the information requested by Google) please provide the following in your application material.
# '''Your complete contact information''', including full name, physical address, preferred email address, and telephone number, plus other pertinent contact information such as IRC handles, etc.
# Why you are interested in the project you are proposing and are well-suited to undertake it.
# A summary of your programming experience and skills.
# Programs or projects you have previously authored or contributed to, in particular those available as open-source, including, if applicable, any past Summer of Code involvement.
# A project plan for the project you are proposing, even if your proposed project is directly based on one of the proposed project ideas for member projects.
#* A project plan in principle divides up the whole project into a series of manageable milestones and time-lines that, when all accomplished, logically lead to the end goal(s) of the project. Put in another way, a project plan explains what you expect you will need to be doing, and what you expect you need to have accomplished, at which time, so that at the end you reach the goals of the project.
#* Do not take this part lightly. A compelling plan takes a significant amount of work. Empirically, applications with no or a hastily composed project plan have not been competitive, and a more thorough project plan can easily make an applicant out compete another with more advanced skills.
#* A good plan will require you to thoroughly think about the project itself and how one might want to go about the work.
#* We don't expect you to have all the experience, background, and knowledge to come up with the final, real work plan on your own at the time you apply. We do expect your plan to demonstrate, however, that you have made the effort and thoroughly dissected the goals into tasks and successive accomplishments that make sense.
#* We strongly recommend that you bounce your proposed project and your project plan draft off of us, using either the pertinent developers mailing list or the IRC channel(s). Through the project plan exercise you will inevitably discover that you are missing a lot of the pieces - we are there to help you fill those in as best as we can.
# Any obligations, vacations, or plans for the summer that may require scheduling during the GSoC work period.
#* We expect the your GSoC project to be your primary focus over the summer.  It should not be regarded as a part-time occupation.
#* If you feel that you can manage other work obligations concurrently with your Summer of Code project, make your case and support it with evidence.
#* Be honest and open.  If it turns out later that you weren't clear about other obligations, at best (i.e., if your accomplishment record at that point is spotless) our trust in you will be severely degraded. Also, if you are accepted, discuss with your GSoC mentor before taking on additional obligations.
#* One of the most common reasons for students to struggle or fail is being overcommitted.  Do not set yourself up for failure!  GSoC summers should be fun and rewarding!
