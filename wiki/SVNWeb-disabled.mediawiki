We have temporarily disabled the web interface SVN::Web CGI service while we attempt to determine if it is a participating factor in server availability issues. Regular anonymous SVN client access is unaffected.

Please contact Chris (dag@sonsorol.org) if this is affecting you and we will attempt to find a reasonable workaround.
