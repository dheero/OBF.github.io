### About Us

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation or O|B|F is a non profit, volunteer
run organization focused on supporting [open
source](wp:open_source "wikilink") programming in
[bioinformatics](wp:bioinformatics "wikilink").

The foundation grew out of the volunteer projects
[BioPerl](BioPerl "wikilink"), [BioJava](BioJava "wikilink") and
[Biopython](Biopython "wikilink") and was formally incorporated in order
to handle our modest requirements of hardware ownership, domain name
management and funding for conferences and workshops.The Foundation does
not participate directly in the development or structure of the open
source work, but as the members of the foundation are drawn from the
member projects, there is clear commonality of direction and purpose.
Occasionally the O|B|F directors may make announcements about our
direction or purpose (a recent one was on the licensing of academic
software) when the board feels there is a need to clarify matters, but
in general we prefer to remain simply the administrative support
organization for our [member projects](Projects "wikilink").

Our main activities are:

-   Underwriting and supporting the [BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") conferences
-   Organizing and supporting developer-centric
    "[Hackathon](Hackathon "wikilink")" events
-   Managing our servers, colocation facilities, bank account & other
    assets

We are incorporated in the state of Delaware, USA as a not-for-profit
company.

### BOSC

[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference](BOSC "wikilink") (BOSC) is held
annually in conjunction with [ISCB's](http://www.iscb.org) meeting ISMB.
[BOSC 2010](BOSC_2010 "wikilink") will be held in conjunction with [ISMB
2010](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2010) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
