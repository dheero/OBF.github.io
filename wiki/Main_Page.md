About Us
--------

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation or O|B|F is a non profit, volunteer
run organization focused on supporting [open
source](wp:open_source "wikilink") programming in
[bioinformatics](wp:bioinformatics "wikilink").

The foundation grew out of the volunteer projects Bioperl, BioJava and
Biopython and was formally incorporated in order to handle our modest
requirements of hardware ownership, domain name management and funding
for conferences and workshops.The Foundation does not participate
directly in the development or structure of the open source work, but as
the members of the foundation are drawn from the member projects, there
is clear commonality of direction and purpose. Occasionally the O|B|F
directors may make announcements about our direction or purpose (a
recent one was on the licensing of academic software) when the board
feels there is a need to clarify matters, but in general we prefer to
remain simply the administrative support organization for our member
projects.

Our main activities are:

-   Underwriting and supporting the [BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") conferences
-   Organizing and supporting developer-centric "hackathon" events
-   Managing our servers, colocation facilities, bank account & other
    assets

We are incorporated in the state of Delaware, USA as a not-for-profit
company.

BOSC

Bioinformatics Open Source Conference or [BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") is held
annually in conjunction with [ISCB's](http://www.iscb.org) meeting ISMB.
We will be holding [BOSC 2006](BOSC_2006 "wikilink") at [ISMB
2006](http://ismb2006.cbi.cnptia.embrapa.br/) in [Fortaleza,
Brazil](wp:Fortaleza,_Brazil "wikilink").
