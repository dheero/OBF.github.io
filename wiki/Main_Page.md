About Us
--------

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation or O|B|F is a non-profit,
volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy
of [Open Source](wp:open_source "wikilink") software development and
[Open Science](wp:Open_science "wikilink") within the biological
research community.

Our main activities are:

-   Running and supporting the [BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") conferences.
-   Organizing and supporting developer-centric
    "[Hackathon](Hackathon "wikilink")" events.
-   [ Participating in the Google Summer of Code
    program](Google_Summer_of_Code "wikilink") on behalf of our [ member
    projects](Projects "wikilink") as an umbrella
    mentoring organization.
-   Managing servers, colocation facilities, bank account, domain names,
    and other assets for the benefit of our [ member
    projects](Projects "wikilink").
-   Public opinion and policy statements about matters related to Open
    Source and Open Science in bioinformatics.

The Foundation does not participate directly in the development or
structure of the open source work, but as the members of the foundation
are drawn from our projects' developer communities, there is clear
commonality of direction and purpose.

O|B|F is governed by a [Board of Directors](Board "wikilink"). [ Our
bylaws](:File:OBF-Bylaws.pdf "wikilink") lay out how the Board is
elected, holds public meetings, and conducts its business, as well as
the scope and role of our [
membership](Open_Bioinformatics_Foundation:Membership_application "wikilink").
O|B|F is an associated project with [Software In The Public Interest,
Inc.](http://spi-inc.org/), a fiscal sponsorship organization, and
through SPI we can accept tax-exempt charitable donations.

History
-------

O|B|F grew out of the volunteer projects [BioPerl](BioPerl "wikilink"),
[BioJava](BioJava "wikilink") and [Biopython](Biopython "wikilink") and
was formally incorporated in 2001 in order to handle modest requirements
of hardware ownership, domain name management and funding for
conferences and workshops. In 2005, we enacted [
bylaws](:File:OBF-Bylaws.pdf "wikilink") for the first time, and along
with it created a formal membership.

In 2012, we decided to give up our own incorporation to associate
ourselves with [Software In The Public Interest,
Inc.](http://spi-inc.org/), a fiscal sponsorship organization that we
felt aligned well with our own values and culture. The bylaws [underwent
a series of changes](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/8), in part to
better reflect our current practices, and in part to pave the way for
joining SPI. The changes [ were approved on Sep 11,
2012](Minutes:2012_Sep_ConfCall "wikilink"), [our membership
overwhelmingly approved of associating with
SPI](http://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/e/OBFjoiningSPI), and as of
October 12, 2012, O|B|F is a SPI-associated project.

BOSC
----

The [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](BOSC "wikilink") is
held annually in conjunction with [ISCB's](http://www.iscb.org) meeting,
ISMB.

[BOSC 2013](BOSC_2013 "wikilink") will take place July 17-18, right
before [ISMB/ECCB 2013](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013) in Berlin,
Germany.
