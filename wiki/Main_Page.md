### About Us

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation or O|B|F is a non-profit,
volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy
of [Open Source](wp:open_source "wikilink") software development and
[Open Science](wp:Open_science "wikilink") within the biological
research community.

Our main activities are:

-   Running and supporting the [BOSC](BOSC "wikilink") conferences.
-   Organizing and supporting developer-centric
    "[Hackathon](Hackathon "wikilink")" events.
-   [ Participating in the Google Summer of Code
    program](Google_Summer_of_Code "wikilink") on behalf of our [ member
    projects](Projects "wikilink") as an umbrella
    mentoring organization.
-   Managing servers, colocation facilities, bank account, domain names,
    and other assets for the benefit of our [ member
    projects](Projects "wikilink").
-   Public opinion and policy statements about matters related to Open
    Source and Open Science in bioinformatics.

As of October 12, 2012, the O|B|F is a [Software in the Public Interest,
Inc.](http://www.spi-inc.org) (SPI) associated project.

-   [ Our bylaws](:File:OBF-Bylaws.pdf "wikilink"), with the
    [changes](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/8) approved on Sep
    11, 2012.

### History

O|B|F grew out of the volunteer projects [BioPerl](BioPerl "wikilink"),
[BioJava](BioJava "wikilink") and [Biopython](Biopython "wikilink") and
was formally incorporated in 2001 in order to handle our modest
requirements of hardware ownership, domain name management and funding
for conferences and workshops. The Foundation does not participate
directly in the development or structure of the open source work, but as
the members of the foundation are drawn from our projects' developer
communities, there is clear commonality of direction and purpose.

### BOSC

The [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](BOSC "wikilink") is
held annually in conjunction with [ISCB's](http://www.iscb.org) meeting,
ISMB.

[BOSC 2013](BOSC_2013 "wikilink") will take place July 17-18, right
before [ISMB/ECCB 2013](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013) in Berlin,
Germany.
