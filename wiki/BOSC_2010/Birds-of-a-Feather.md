Friday BOFs (Day 1)
-------------------

-   Dana Robinson - BioHDF, HDF5-based NGS data storage.

<!-- -->

-   Biology in Python -- discussion on doing bioinformatics work with
    the fabulous Python programming language, using libraries
    like Biopython.

Saturday BOFs (Day 2)
---------------------

-   Representing/Querying NGS Data in HBase/Hadoop -- a BOF to discuss
    how to represent, process, and query NGS data in HBase
    and/or HDFS/Hadoop. I'm interested in discussing ideas of how to
    represent information of interest to NGS researchers (specifically
    focused on variants, small indels, large indels, structural
    variation etc) in HBase tables.
