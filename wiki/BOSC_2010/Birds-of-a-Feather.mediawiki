* Biology in Python -- discussion on doing bioinformatics work with the fabulous Python programming language, using libraries like Biopython.

== Saturday BOFs (Day 2) ==

* Representing/Querying NGS Data in HBase/Hadoop -- a BOF to discuss how to represent, process, and query NGS data in HBase and/or HDFS/Hadoop. I'm interested in discussing ideas of how to represent information of interest to NGS researchers (specifically focused on variants, small indels, large indels, structural variation etc) in HBase tables.
