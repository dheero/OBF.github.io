OpenBio Codefest 2012 will take place July 11th and 12th, 2012 (the two days before [[BOSC 2012]]) in Los Angeles, California at [http://www.lmu.edu/ Loyola Marymount University]. This is a great opportunity for open source bioinformatics developers to meet and work collaboratively. We hope to have developers from projects such as [http://bioperl.org BioPerl], [http://www.biojava.org BioJava], [http://biopython.org Biopython], [http://www.bioruby.org BioRuby], [http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/ Galaxy] and [http://www.emboss.org EMBOSS] in attendance.

This is a follow-up to [[Codefest 2010]] in Boston and [[Codefest 2011]] in Vienna.

== Goals ==

OpenBio projects are typically coordinated remotely, with users from all over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing lists and IRC chats. Additionally, contributors work on these projects in their spare time, coordinating improving the projects with their day jobs and life outside of the computer.
The objective of the Codefest is to give these talented developers a chance to be fully focused on the projects for a few days, interacting in real time. Previous [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon Hackathons] have been immensely successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project developments.

The goals for the two days are determined entirely by developers. We welcome your input. Please add your thoughts to the shared Google document:

* During the Codefest, on IRC (freenode/#codefest)

== Location ==

We are being hosted by the [http://cse.lmu.edu/departments/math.htm math department at LMU].

Many thanks to Kam Dahlquist for help in organizing.

== Travel and Hotels ==

LMU is located a short cab ride from [http://www.lawa.org/welcomeLAX.aspx Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)]. Logistically, we hope attendees will fly into LAX, spend the Codefest time at a hotel near LMU, and then travel down to Long Beach on the night of the 12th for BOSC and ISMB.

We will work to arrange group transport from LMU to Long Beach on the night of the 12th.

There are several hotels nearby:
