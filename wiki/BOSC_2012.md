Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is a satellite of
[ISMB](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012). It is sponsored by the Open
Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for
well over a decade. When the first BOSC (Bioinformatics Open Source
Conference) was held in 2000, there were already a number of popular
open source bioinformatics packages, and the number and range of these
projects has increased dramatically since then. Many open source
bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community across
a wide variety of applications. Open source bioinformatics software has
facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination, and wide adoption of new
computational methods, reusable software components, and standards.

BOSC brings together bioinformatics open source developers from all over
the world so they can forge connections each other (both within and
across projects), increase the visibility of their work, and collaborate
to build shared resources. Participants can work together to create use
cases, prototype working code, or run hands-on tutorials in new software
packages and emerging technologies. For those who are bioinformatics
software users rather than developers, BOSC introduces or updates them
on a wide array of projects that they might find useful.

Please spread the word about BOSC to interested developers; all are
welcome. On Twitter, we recommend the hash tag \#bosc2012.

Sessions
--------

-   **Cloud and Parallel Computing** -- This session will cover
    cloud-based approaches to improving software and data accessibility.
    The emergence of [cloud
    computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) has made
    highly scalable cluster computing available to
    computational biologists. Services such as [Amazon's Elastic Compute
    Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) combined with [publicly available
    datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/#1) promise to lower
    the overhead to participate in large scale data analyses. Talks will
    focus on how the community can build up resources, datasets, and
    workflows for making the best use of cloud infrastructure. We will
    also include talks on data-parallel approaches to analyzing massive
    data sets, such as those resulting from next-generation sequencing
    and mass spec proteomics, and reports on the parallelization of
    bioinformatics algorithms in general.
-   **Linked Data** -- Linked Data is an emerging set of conventions on
    using basic Semantic Web standards (HTTP URIs and
    [RDF](http://dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf/) in particular) to
    expose, share, and connect data, information, and knowledge online.
    Linked Data principles are increasingly being embraced by
    bioinformatics resources. For example, UniProt is now being made
    fully available in
    [RDF](http://dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf/) , and
    collaborative initiatives such as [Bio2RDF](http://bio2rdf.org/) aim
    to expose many commonly used database resources to data integration
    through RDF and its query language, SPARQL. This session is devoted
    to reports on software that works with such new data stores, or aids
    in their development, including technologies for interoperable web
    services, and tools for ontology building or maintenance.
-   **Genome-scale Data Management** -- This session will focus on
    processes and technologies that support the creating, managing and
    reporting of genomic data. This session is appropriate for
    discussion of systems that involve components such as (but not
    limited to) Ensembl and GMOD/Chado data stores, Taverna and Galaxy
    analysis workflows, and BioMart and InterMine warehouses.
-   **Data Visualization and Imaging** -- This session will address
    visualization techniques and tools that provide insight into large
    and highly complex biomedical data sets , as well as biological
    image processing, analysis and data management. Talks that address
    the development of frameworks and communities are
    particularly welcome.
-   **Translational Bioinformatics** -- This session will explore
    applications of biological and medical informatics to the
    development of personalized healthcare, therapies, and a better
    understanding of human health and disease. Topics include the
    analysis of human microarray and other 'omics data, bioinformatics
    methodologies for clinical research, and tools for discovering
    clinically useful associations in human databases.
-   **Software Interoperability** (possibly a joint session with
    [BSI-SIG, the Software Interoperability
    SIG](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/bsi-sig/)) -- Open
    Source approaches to integrating the latest bioinformatics tools.
    Examples of interoperability environments include Galaxy, Cytoscape,
    caBIG, and myGrid.
-   **Bioinformatics Open Source Project Updates** -- This session will
    feature short talks from ongoing projects describing their
    recent progress. Abstracts will be solicited from open source
    projects affiliated with the O|B|F (see
    <http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects>), including the Bio\*
    projects, DAS, BioMOBY, EMBOSS, and GMOD, but any other open-source
    project will be equally eligible to submit presentations for
    this session.
-   **Panel: Interfacing with Industry** -- Companies are more and more
    seeing the benefits of working with open source code and making
    their own code open; meanwhile, academics frequently partner with
    companies on their research projects. We encourage submissions from
    companies that work with open source software, as well as developers
    from non-commercial organizations who collaborate with companies. We
    anticipate a broadly useful conversation about the benefits and
    pitfalls of academic/commercial interaction.

    the conference.

Keynote Speakers
----------------

### Jonathan Eisen

Dr. Eisen is a professor of evolutionary biology at U. C. Davis, and
also has an adjunct position at the Department of Energy Joint Genome
Institute in Walnut Creek, CA. His research focuses on the origin of
novelty (how new processes and functions originate). Dr. Eisen is
heavily involved in the Open Access publishing movement and is Academic
Editor in Chief of PLoS Biology. In 2011, he was awarded the 2012
Benjamin Franklin Award for Open Access in the Life Sciences.

His talk is entitled "Science Wants to Be Open - If Only We Could Get
Out of Its Way":

*Scientific research and education is inherently an open activity. Yet
the culture of scientific practice has inserted barriers in the way of
this openness in every conceivable area from peer review, to publishing,
to sharing resources, to education. I will argue that most or even all
of these barriers are unnecessary and should be eliminated for
scientific progress to be most efficient.*

### Suzanna Lewis

Suzanna Lewis is the head of the Berkeley Bioinformatics and Open Source
Projects and a founder of the Gene Ontology Consortium. In addition to
the Gene Ontology, she is involved in the OBO Foundry, the Phenotypic
Quality Ontology, modENCODE, and the Generic Model Organism Database
Project.

Her talk is entitled "Fun with Standards":

*The Web is a wonderful soapbox for publishing data of all kinds. Labs
of all sizes are using it to distribute their results and conclusions to
the entire world. As DNA sequencers and other lab instruments continue
to improve, the sheer volume of this information is going to continue to
increase super-linearly. Providing open access to it is straightforward
from a technical standpoint, but if you are a consumer, trying to locate
particular data, then trolling the Web is not much better than rolling
dice. Zipf’s law applies, and the things you are most interested in can
only be found in a tiny minority of the items available on the Web.*

*Standards, as a topic, do not make a heart flutter with excitement or
chills go up your spine. Despite this, in order to find the data I was
after, I have been involved in designing a number of controlled
vocabularies and ontologies such as the Gene Ontology and the Phenotypic
Quality Ontology, and I have learned from these experiences. In this
talk I will discuss: information space as a graph made up of simple
relationships between things; what physical centralization can offer;
standards as a way to enable interoperability which in turn can drive
innovation; and the relative (in)effectiveness of top-down
standardization committees.*
