Open Source License Requirement
-------------------------------

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which sponsors
BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open
Source Software Development within the biological research community.
For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a specific
software system for use by the research community, then that software
must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available
(including source code) for download as a tar/zip file accessed through
ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like
cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.
