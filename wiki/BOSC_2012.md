The 13th Annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2012) will
take place July 13-14, 2012, in Long Beach, CA, right before [ISMB
2012](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012).

Important Dates
---------------

-   March 1, 2012: Call for Abstracts opens
-   **July 13-14, 2012: BOSC 2012**
-   July 15-17, 2012: [ISMB 2012](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012)

Sessions
--------

-   **Cloud and Parallel Computing** -- This session will cover
    cloud-based approaches to improving software and data accessibility.
    The emergence of [cloud
    computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) has made
    highly scalable cluster computing available to
    computational biologists. Services such as [Amazon's Elastic Compute
    Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) combined with [publicly available
    datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/#1) promise to lower
    the overhead to participate in large scale data analyses. Talks will
    focus on how the community can build up resources, datasets, and
    workflows for making the best use of cloud infrastructure. We will
    also include talks on data-parallel approaches to analyzing massive
    data sets, such as those resulting from next-generation sequencing
    and mass spec proteomics, and reports on the parallelization of
    bioinformatics algorithms in general.
-   **Linked Data** -- Linked Data is an emerging set of conventions on
    using basic Semantic Web standards (HTTP URIs and
    [RDF](http://dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf/) in particular) to
    expose, share, and connect data, information, and knowledge online.
    Linked Data principles are increasingly being embraced by
    bioinformatics resources. For example, UniProt is now being made
    fully available in
    [RDF](http://dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf/) , and
    collaborative initiatives such as [Bio2RDF](http://bio2rdf.org/) aim
    to expose many commonly used database resources to data integration
    through RDF and its query language, SPARQL. This session is devoted
    to reports on software that works with such new data stores, or aids
    in their development, including technologies for interoperable web
    services, and tools for ontology building or maintenance.
-   **Genome-scale Data Management** -- This session will focus on
    processes and technologies that support the creating, managing and
    reporting of genomic data. This session is appropriate for
    discussion of systems that involve components such as (but not
    limited to) Ensembl and GMOD/Chado data stores, Taverna and Galaxy
    analysis workflows, and BioMart and InterMine warehouses.
-   **Data Visualization and Imaging** -- This session will address
    visualization techniques and tools that provide insight into large
    and highly complex biomedical data sets , as well as biological
    image processing, analysis and data management. Talks that address
    the development of frameworks and communities are
    particularly welcome.
-   **Translational Bioinformatics** -- This session will explore
    applications of biological and medical informatics to the
    development of personalized healthcare, therapies, and a better
    understanding of human health and disease. Topics include the
    analysis of human microarray and other 'omics data, bioinformatics
    methodologies for clinical research, and tools for discovering
    clinically useful associations in human databases.
-   **Bioinformatics Open Source Project Updates** -- This session will
    feature short talks from ongoing projects describing their
    recent progress. Abstracts will be solicited from open source
    projects affiliated with the O|B|F (see
    <http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects>), including the Bio\*
    projects, DAS, BioMOBY, EMBOSS, and GMOD, but any other open-source
    project will be equally eligible to submit presentations for
    this session.
-   **Panel: Interfacing with Industry** -- Companies are more and more
    seeing the benefits of working with open source code and making
    their own code open; meanwhile, academics frequently partner with
    companies on their research projects. We encourage submissions from
    companies that work with open source software, as well as developers
    from non-commercial organizations who collaborate with companies. We
    anticipate a broadly useful conversation about the benefits and
    pitfalls of academic/commercial interaction.

Open Source License Requirement
-------------------------------

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which sponsors
BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open
Source Software Development within the biological research community.
For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a specific
software system for use by the research community, then that software
must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available
(including source code) for download as a tar/zip file accessed through
ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like
cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.
