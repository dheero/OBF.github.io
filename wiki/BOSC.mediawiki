The '''B'''ioinformatics '''O'''pen '''S'''ource '''C'''onference is held annually (as a satellite of the [http://www.iscb.org/ ISCB's annual ISMB conference]) to promote and facilitate [[wp:open source|open source]] development of [[wp:bioinformatics|bioinformatics]] tools.  The aims of the conferences are to: 
# Provide developers with a forum for displaying the results of their development efforts to the wider research community; 
# Provide a focused environment for developers and users to interact and share ideas about software development, and practical techniques in bioinformatics; 
# Inform the Research Community of important developments occurring within the Open Source Bioinformatics Developer community.
