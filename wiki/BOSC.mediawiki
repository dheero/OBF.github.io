The '''B'''ioinformatics '''O'''pen '''S'''ource '''C'''onference is held annually as a Special Interest Group (SIG) of the [http://www.iscb.org/ ISCB's annual ISMB conference]). BOSC promotes and facilitates the [[wp:open source|open source]] development of [[wp:bioinformatics|bioinformatics]] tools and open science.  The aims of the conferences are to: 
# Provide developers with a forum for displaying the results of their development efforts to the wider research community; 
# Provide a focused environment for developers and users to interact and share ideas about software development, open science, and practical techniques in bioinformatics; 
# Promote Open Science, with its focus on sharing data and tools, transparency, reproducibility, and data provenance
# Inform the research community of important developments occurring within the Open Source Bioinformatics Developer community.
