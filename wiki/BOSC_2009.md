BOSC 2009 will be held for 2 days in conjunction with [the 17th Annual
International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology
(ISMB 2009)](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2009/index.php) in Stockholm,
Sweden (which itself will be held jointly with the 7th European
Conference on Computational Biology, ECCB 2009). The dates of BOSC 2009
are June 27 - 28; the main ISMB/ECCB Conference runs June 29 - July 2,
2009.

Please see [past BOSC conferences](Past_BOSC_conferences "wikilink") for
the previous 9 conferences.

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly
apply to their own work.

The BOSC 2009 Organizing committee is pleased to announce our two
Keynote Speakers:

### Alan Ruttenberg

[Alan Ruttenberg](http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/ruttenberg/)
is a Principal Scientist at [Science
Commons](http://sciencecommons.org). He works with Semantic Web
technologies in computational biology, with an emphasis on the creation
and application of structured biological knowledge to interpret
experimental results.

### Robert S. Hanmer

Robert S. Hanmer is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff in the
Technical Component Management area in Alcatel-Lucent’s Operations area.
He is based in Naperville, Illinois, USA. Current responsibilities
include developing software-sourcing strategies for middleware and open
source software. Previous positions within Lucent and Bell Laboratories
have included development, architecture and evaluation of highly
reliable systems focusing especially on the areas of reliability and
performance. He is active in the software patterns community, including
serving as program chair at several pattern conferences. He has authored
or co-authored 14 journal articles, several book chapters and the book
Patterns for Fault Tolerant Software. He is a member of the IEEE
Computer Society, a Senior Member of the ACM and current President of
[The Hillside Group](http://hillside.net/), the organization that
sponsors the PLoP conference. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in
Computer Science from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

Sessions
--------

This year’s conference will mark the 10th anniversary of BOSC. To
celebrate the special occasion, the theme of this year’s conference is
“Looking Back and Looking Ahead: Open Source Solutions to Grand
Challenges in Bioinformatics.” We are inviting abstracts for two
different types of talks:

-   Descriptions of a particular open source software implementation by
    a member of the development team, especially in the areas listed
    below
-   Reviews of open source software that compares and contrasts
    different solutions to the same bioinformatics problem.

In addition, we are asking all speakers to come prepared to lead an
informal tutorial on their software during a Birds of a
Feather/hackathon session. This year’s topics include:

-   **Design Patterns in Bioinformatics** (topic organizer: [Lonnie
    Welch](http://www.ohio.edu/cidds/welch/))
    -   Various recurring patterns have emerged in the field
        of bioinformataics. The open source community has created many
        of these patterns, and this session will feature presentations
        that analyze and codify bioinformatics patterns. See
        <http://hillside.net/patterns/> for definitions and examples
        of patterns.
-   **Regulatory Genomics** (topic organizer: [Lonnie
    Welch](http://www.ohio.edu/cidds/welch/))
    -   This session will focus on open source software that is designed
        for decoding the regulatory aspects, i.e., the control systems,
        of the genomes.
-   **Multicore and GPGPU computing** (topic organizer: [Frank
    Drews](http://frankdrews.com/))
-   **Data & Analysis Management** (topic organizer: [Anton
    Nekrutenko](http://www.bx.psu.edu/~anton/))
    -   Shared session with [DAM SIG](http://www.dam-sig.org/) for
        introduction of cutting edge applications that mold data sources
        and analysis tools into a singular medium benefitting both
        extremes on the user spectrum: experimentalists and
        computational researchers
-   **Computational Grids** (topic organizers: [Steffen
    Möller](http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/mitarbeiter/moeller/), [Frank
    Drews](http://frankdrews.com/))
    -   Presentation of projects in computational biology that adapted
        grid technologies for their research or services. The speaker
        should explain how heterogeneous resources from multiple
        geographical locations were brought together to achieve what
        barely could have been achieved alone.
-   **Visualization** (topic organizers: [Jim
    Procter](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk), [Seán
    O'Donoghue](http://www-db.embl.de/jss/EmblGroupsHD/per_4631.html))

There will also be updates from O|B|F-sponsored projects, and as always,
abstracts may be submitted for open source software that does not fit
neatly into the above categories. Lightning Talks will also highlight
very recent developments.

Abstract Submission Information
-------------------------------

The deadline for abstract submissions is Monday, April 13. Abstract
submissions will **not** be accepted via e-mail this year. All abstracts
are to be submitted through our [EasyChair conference
site](https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=bosc2009).

Abstracts must be one page in length and submitted **as a PDF file
only**. Please observe the following formatting guidelines

-   Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom of
    the page.
-   List the following elements in order from the top of the page:
    -   Title
    -   Authors, with the presenting author's name underlined.
    -   Author affiliations, including the e-mail address of the
        presenting author.
    -   URL for the overall project web site
    -   URL for accessing the code
    -   The particular Open Source License being used
-   The abstracts will be presented "as is" in the program booklet

Accepted talks will be 10-20 minutes, depending on the session. You will
be notified of the length of your talk upon abstract acceptance.

Submissions for Lightning Talks (length ~5 minutes) will be accepted up
until the day of the conference, though submission to the program
following the above guidelines is strongly encouraged to facilitate
better planning. The open-source license requirement (see below) applies
equally to lightning talks.

### Open Source License Requirement

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which is the sole
sponsor of BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy
of Open Source Software Development within the biological research
community. For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a
specific software system for use by the research community, then that
software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be
available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file
accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control
system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.

See the following websites for further information:

-   [Recognized Open Source
    Licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/)
-   [Definition of the Open Source
    Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)

### Post-conference Slide Availability

-   In the spirit of openness, we would like to make the presentation
    slides publicly available after the conference.
-   The organizers will be requesting an electronic copy of the slides
    for posting.
-   For example, see slides from BOSC 2008 on
    [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/tag/bosc_2008).
