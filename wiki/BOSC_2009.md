BOSC 2009 will be held for 2 days in conjunction with [the 17th Annual
International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology
(ISMB 2009)](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2009/index.php) in Stockholm,
Sweden. ISMB 2009 will be held jointly with the 7th Annual European
Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB 2009). The dates of BOSC 2009
are June 27 - 28; the main ISMB/ECCB Conference runs June 29 - July 2,
2009.

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community. To be considered
for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic in a
presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open
Source License, and be freely available for download in source code
form.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly
apply to their own work.

This year’s conference will mark the 10th anniversary of BOSC. To
celebrate the special occasion, the theme of this year’s conference is
“Looking Back and Looking Ahead: Open Source Solutions to Grand
Challenges in Bioinformatics.” We are inviting abstracts for two
different types of talks:

-   Descriptions of a particular open source software implementation by
    a member of the development team, especially in the areas listed
    below
-   Reviews of open source software that compares and contrasts
    different solutions to the same bioinformatics problem.

In addition, we are asking all speakers to come prepared to lead an
informal tutorial on their software during a Birds of a
Feather/hackathon session. This year’s topics include:

-   Design Patterns in Bioinformatics
-   Regulatory Genomics
-   Multicore and GPGPU computing
-   Data & Analysis Management (shared session with DAM SIG)
-   Computational Grids
-   Visualization

There will also be updates from O|B|F-sponsored projects, and as always,
abstracts may be submitted for open source software that does not fit
neatly into the above categories. Lightning Talks will also highlight
very recent developments.
