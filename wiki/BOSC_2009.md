BOSC 2009 will be held for 2 days in conjunction with [the 17th Annual
International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology
(ISMB 2009)](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2009/index.php) in Stockholm,
Sweden (which itself will be held jointly with the 7th European
Conference on Computational Biology, ECCB 2009). The dates of BOSC 2009
are June 27 - 28; the main ISMB/ECCB Conference runs June 29 - July 2,
2009.

Please see [past BOSC conferences](Past_BOSC_conferences "wikilink") for
the previous 9 conferences.

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly
apply to their own work.

Keynote Speakers
----------------

The BOSC 2009 Organizing committee is pleased to announce our two
Keynote Speakers:

### Alan Ruttenberg

[Alan Ruttenberg](http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/ruttenberg/)
is a Principal Scientist at [Science
Commons](http://sciencecommons.org). He works with Semantic Web
technologies in computational biology, with an emphasis on the creation
and application of structured biological knowledge to interpret
experimental results. He is currently involved in a number of open
biomedical ontology efforts, including: the Ontology for Biomedical
Investigations (OBI), the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) that will form the
upper level ontology for the OBO foundry, the Infectious Disease
Ontology (IDO), the Program on Ontologies of Neural Structures (PONS),
the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), and BioPAX-OBO for representing
molecular and cellular pathways. These interests and efforts come
together in my project at Science Commons - the Neurocommons, a large
scale Semantic Web knowledge base of biological information aimed at
supporting, initially, the neurosciences. He is also an active
participant in W3C Semantic Web activities. In 2006 and 2007 he was a
member of the Health Care Life Sciences Interest Group, and early work
on the Neurocommons became the core of the prototype life sciences
knowledge base that the group has documented. He is a chair of the OWL
Working Group specifying OWL 2, and a coordinating editor of the OBO
Foundry. His graduate work was at the MIT Media Lab in the Music and
Cognition Group, and he has an undergraduate degree in Physics and
Mathematics from Brandeis University.

His talk at BOSC will be entitled "Can we reduce the burden of data
integration? Challenge and opportunity in building the web of data".

### Robert S. Hanmer

Robert S. Hanmer is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff in the
Technical Component Management area in Alcatel-Lucent’s Operations area.
He is based in Naperville, Illinois, USA. Current responsibilities
include developing software-sourcing strategies for middleware and open
source software. Previous positions within Lucent and Bell Laboratories
have included development, architecture and evaluation of highly
reliable systems focusing especially on the areas of reliability and
performance. He is active in the software patterns community, including
serving as program chair at several pattern conferences. He has authored
or co-authored 14 journal articles, several book chapters and the book
Patterns for Fault Tolerant Software. He is a member of the IEEE
Computer Society, a Senior Member of the ACM and current President of
[The Hillside Group](http://hillside.net/), the organization that
sponsors the PLoP conference. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in
Computer Science from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

His talk at BOSC will be entitled "Software Patterns for Reusable
Design".

Sessions
--------

This year’s conference will mark the 10th anniversary of BOSC. To
celebrate the special occasion, the theme of this year’s conference is
“Looking Back and Looking Ahead: Open Source Solutions to Grand
Challenges in Bioinformatics.”

Ware asking all speakers to come prepared to lead an informal tutorial
on their software during a Birds of a Feather/hackathon session. This
year’s topics include:

-   **Design Patterns in Bioinformatics** (topic organizer: [Lonnie
    Welch](http://www.ohio.edu/cidds/welch/))
    -   Various recurring patterns have emerged in the field
        of bioinformatics. The open source community has created many of
        these patterns, and this session will feature presentations that
        analyze and codify bioinformatics patterns. See
        <http://hillside.net/patterns/> for definitions and examples
        of patterns.
-   **Regulatory Genomics** (topic organizer: [Lonnie
    Welch](http://www.ohio.edu/cidds/welch/))
    -   This session will focus on open source software that is designed
        for decoding the regulatory aspects, i.e., the control systems,
        of the genomes.
-   **Multicore and GPGPU computing** (topic organizer: [Frank
    Drews](http://frankdrews.com/))
-   **Data & Analysis Management** (topic organizer: [Anton
    Nekrutenko](http://www.bx.psu.edu/~anton/))
    -   Shared session with [DAM SIG](http://www.dam-sig.org/) for
        introduction of cutting edge applications that mold data sources
        and analysis tools into a singular medium benefitting both
        extremes on the user spectrum: experimentalists and
        computational researchers
-   **Computational Grids** (topic organizers: [Steffen
    Möller](http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/mitarbeiter/moeller/), [Frank
    Drews](http://frankdrews.com/))
    -   Presentation of projects in computational biology that adapted
        grid technologies for their research or services. The speaker
        should explain how heterogeneous resources from multiple
        geographical locations were brought together to achieve what
        barely could have been achieved alone.
-   **Visualization** (topic organizers: [Jim
    Procter](http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk))
-   **Bio\* Updates**
    -   Updates from O|B|F-sponsored projects
-   **Open Source Software**
    -   Open source software that does not fit neatly into the
        above categories.
-   **Lightning Talks** will also highlight very recent developments.
