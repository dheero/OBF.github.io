title: BOSC Abstract Submission
---

![BOSC logo|link=BOSC\_2015](Pear.png "BOSC logo|link=BOSC_2015")

The official deadline for submitting abstracts for BOSC talks was in
April; however, we have a few spots saved for Late-Breaking Lightning
Talks and posters. (There will also be a few spots reserved for walk-in
posters; however, those will not be listed in the program or on the BOSC
website.)

[Abstracts](http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2015/openconf.php) for
Late-Breaking Lightning Talks and posters are due by **5 June** 2015 at
9pm PDT, and are subject to the same requirements and review process as
earlier submissions. You will be notified of your acceptance status on
14 June 2015.

### Special note to authors who want to resubmit

**If you already submitted an abstract in the first round and would like
to submit a revised abstract for considering as a Late-Breaking
Lightning Talk, please do so as a [new
submission](http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2015/author/submit.php)
rather than updating your previous one. Annoyingly, the OpenConf
software won't allow you to submit a new abstract with the same title as
your old one. However, you can trick it by adding a space at the
beginning (or end?) of your title. We apologize for the inconvenience!**

Abstracts must be **one page** (8.5 inches by 11 inches) in length and
submitted **as a PDF (preferred), Microsoft Word, or text file**.

You may wish to use one of these abstract templates:

-   [PDF](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/File:BOSC2015-abstract-template.pdf)
    (not fillable)
-   [Markdown to
    PDF](https://s3.amazonaws.com/chapmanb/openbio/bosc_template_pandoc.tar.gz)

-   [Word (.docx)](http://www.open-bio.org/bosc2015/bosc2015-abstract-example.docx)
-   [Pages](http://www.open-bio.org/bosc2015/bosc2015-abstract-example.pages)

If you want to submit your abstract in plain text format, please be sure
to use the file extension ".txt" or the abstract submission system will
reject it.

Please use one of the provided templates or format your abstract as
follows:

-   Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom of
    the page.
-   Include the following pieces of information in order from the top of

        presenting author.
    -   URL for the overall project web site
    -   URL for accessing the code
    -   The particular Open Source License being used
-   The abstracts will be printed "as is" in the program booklet; please

    formatting guidelines above.

To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the
central topic in a presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with
a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for download

download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through
ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like
