### Posters

We have reserved a few spaces for walk-in posters, which must meet the
BOSC requirements of open source and recognized license. The ISMB staff
specify that posters should not exceed the following dimensions: 0.95 m
wide x 1.30 m high.

### Open Source Requirement

To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the
central topic in a talk or poster submitted to BOSC must be licensed
with a recognized Open Source License, and be freely available for
download in source code form at the time they are reviewed.

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which sponsors
BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open
Source Software Development within the biological research community.
For this reason, if a submitted abstract concerns a specific software
system for use by the research community, then that software must be
licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for
download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through
ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like
cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.

    Licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/)

    Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)
