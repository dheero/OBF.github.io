[BOSC 2015](BOSC_2015 "wikilink") took place July 10-11 in Dublin,
Ireland. Check out the complete
[schedule](BOSC_2015_Schedule "wikilink") with links to slides, posters
and videos - mostly on our [F1000 Research BOSC
Channel](http://f1000research.com/channels/BOSC), with the videos on the
[BOSC
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir-OOQiOhXbENjAIFF-JZ0WodnysPqfh).

BOSC 2016 will be held in Orlando, Florida, on July 8-9, 2016, right
before ISMB 2016.

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is run as a two-day
meeting before the annual [ISMB
conference](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015). It is sponsored by the
[Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](Main_Page "wikilink"), a
non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of
Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological
research community.

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for
well over a decade. When the first BOSC was held in 2000, there were
already many popular open source bioinformatics packages, and the number
and range of these projects has increased dramatically since then. BOSC
covers the wide range of open source bioinformatics software being
developed, and encompasses the growing movement of Open Science, with
its focus on transparency, reproducibility, and data provenance. We
welcome submissions relating to all aspects of bioinformatics and open
science software, including new computational methods, reusable software
components, visualization, interoperability, and other approaches that
help to advance research in the biomolecular sciences. Two full days of
[talks, posters, panel discussions](BOSC_2015_Schedule "wikilink"), and
[iinformal discussion
groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaSjWEZzwiAk6jUiKVk_pbmru1uCJuGbgITIyI3kmfI/edit#)
will enable BOSC attendees to interact with other developers and share
ideas and code, as well as learning about some of the latest
developments in the field of open source bioinformatics.

We also organize a two-day community development session prior to the
conference ([Codefest 2015](Codefest_2015 "wikilink")). This is an
opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and
programming to meet, discuss and work collaboratively. Everyone is
welcome to attend Codefest (whether or not you attend BOSC).

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [follow

Sponsors
--------

BOSC is organised by the [Open Bioinformatics
Foundation](Main_Page "wikilink"), a non-profit, volunteer-run group
dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development and Open Science within the biological research
community.

We gratefully accept sponsorships from relevant private companies. These
sponsorships enable us to offer free registration to some BOSC speakers
to lower the financial barrier of their attendance. If you would like to
be a sponsor of BOSC, please contact us at at bosc@open-bio.org.

Important Dates
---------------

-   BOSC 2016: July 8-9, 2016, Orlando, FL, USA
-   [ISMB 2016](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2016): July 8-12,, 2016,
    Orlando, FL, USA

Registration
------------

Because BOSC is run as a two-day Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting at
the annual ISMB conference, [registration is via ISMB
2016](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2016). You can register for BOSC (which
allows you to drop in on other SIGs as well), or register to attend the
full ISMB/ECCB conference plus BOSC.

Session Topics
--------------

We welcome submissions relating to all aspects of bioinformatics and
open science software, including (but not limited to):

-   **Open Science and Reproducible Research** -- covers the theory and
    practice of open science, including open notebook science, open
    data, transparent and reproducible workflows, and shared standards
    for reviewing and publishing research papers.
-   **Standards and Interoperability** -- includes standards such as
    ontologies, formats, etc, as well as Open Source approaches to
    integrating the latest bioinformatics tools, exploring how we can
    increase tool connectivity and help communities work
    better together.
-   **Data Science** -- encompasses software and approaches to managing,
    exploring, and analyzing large-scale data to address research
    questions, such as genome assembly, variant prediction, eQTL
    analysis, phylogenomics, and epigenetics.
-   **Visualization** -- focuses on approaches for interactive as well
    as static visual representations of biomedical data, ranging from
    exploration to explanation.
-   **Translational Bioinformatics** -- explores applications of
    biological and medical informatics to the development of
    personalized healthcare, therapies, and a better understanding of
    human health and disease. Topics include the analysis of large scale
    population and family sequencing data, bioinformatics methodologies
    for clinical research, and tools for discovering clinically useful
    associations in human databases.
-   **Bioinformatics Open Source Libraries and Projects** -- features
    short talks from new or ongoing projects describing their
    recent progress. Abstracts will be solicited from open source
    projects affiliated with the OBF (see
    <http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects>), including the Bio\*
    projects, DAS, BioMOBY, EMBOSS, and GMOD, but any other open-source
    project will be equally eligible to submit abstracts for
    this session.
