BOSC 2010 is currently in the planning stages.  It will be held for 2 days in conjunction with [http://www.iscb.org/ismb2010 the 18th Annual International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 2010)] in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  The dates of BOSC 2009 are July 9-10; the main ISMB/ECCB Conference runs July 11-13, 2010.

Please see [[Past BOSC conferences|past BOSC conferences]] for the previous 10 conferences.


== Overview ==
The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. 

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination, and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming together of the open source developer community in one location to meet face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies.  In short, BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly apply to their own work.

== Open Source License Requirement ==

The [[OBF|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], which is the sole sponsor of BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software Development within the biological research community. For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a specific software system for use by the research community, then that software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.
