BOSC 2010 is currently in the planning stages.  It will be held for 2 days in conjunction with [http://www.iscb.org/ismb2010 the 18th Annual International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 2010)] in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  The dates of BOSC 2010 are July 9-10; the main ISMB Conference runs July 11-13, 2010.

Please see [[Past BOSC conferences|past BOSC conferences]] for the previous 10 conferences.


== Overview ==
The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. 

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination, and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming together of the open source developer community in one location to meet face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies.  In short, BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly apply to their own work.

== Important Dates ==

* February 18, 2010:  Call for abstracts opens
* March 9, 2010: Registration opens
* April 15, 2010: Abstract deadline
* May 5, 2010: Notification of accepted abstracts
* May 28, 2010: Early Registration Discount Cut-off Date
* July 7-8, 2010: [[Codefest 2010]] programming session
* July 9-10, 2010:  BOSC 2010!

== Abstract Submission Information ==

The deadline for abstract submissions is Thursday, April 15.  Abstract submissions will '''not''' be accepted via e-mail this year.  All abstracts are to be  submitted through our Open Conferences System site.

Abstracts must be one page in length and submitted '''as a PDF file only'''.  Please observe the following formatting guidelines
* Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom of the page.
* List the following elements in order from the top of the page:
** Title
** Authors, with the presenting author's name underlined.
** Author affiliations, including the e-mail address of the presenting author.
** URL for the overall project web site
** URL for accessing the code
** The particular Open Source License being used
* The abstracts will be presented "as is" in the program booklet
* '''NOTE: upload your one-page, PDF-formatted abstract to the Open Conference System site as the ''paper''.  The 50-word abstract referred to in the system is unnecessary since you are uploading your abstract as a PDF file.'''

Accepted talks will be 10-20 minutes, depending on the session. You will be notified of the length of your talk upon abstract acceptance.

Submissions for Lightning Talks (length ~5 minutes) will be accepted up until the day of the conference, though submission to the program following the above guidelines is strongly encouraged to facilitate better planning. The open-source license requirement (see below) applies equally to lightning talks.


=== Open Source License Requirement ===

The [[OBF|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], which is the sole sponsor of BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software Development within the biological research community. For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a specific software system for use by the research community, then that software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.

See the following websites for further information:

* [http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php Definition of the Open Source Philosophy]
