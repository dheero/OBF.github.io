The 9th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2008) will
take place in [Toronto, Ontario, Canada](wp:Toronto "wikilink"), as one
of several Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings occurring in
conjunction with the 16th annual Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology Conference ([ISMB 2008](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2008/)).

Overview
========

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
[Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink") (O|B|F), a non-profit
group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development within the biological research community. Many Open
Source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community
across many application areas and form a cornerstone in enabling
research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source bioinformatics
software has facilitated rapid innovation and dissemination of new
computational methods as well as informatics infrastructure. Since the
work of the Open Source Bioinformatics Community represents some of the
most cutting edge of Bioinformatics in general, the overall themes for
the conference this year are emerging technologies and hard problems in
bioinformatics. Topics under this umbrella include infrastructure and
data modeling, web 2.0 technologies, workflows, visualization, and best
practices of software design and engineering. We will also have a series
of update talks about the main Open Source Bioinformatics Software
suites. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming together of the open
source developer community in one location. A face-to-face meeting of
this community creates synergy where participants can work together to
create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done.

of Open Source Software Development within the Biological Research
Community. For this reason, in order to be considered for acceptance,
any talk submitted to be presented at BOSC which concerns a specific
software system to be used by the research community must be licensed
with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download by
anyone using ftp, cvs/subversion, or as a tar/zip file from the Project
