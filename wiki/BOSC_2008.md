The 9th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2008) will
take place in [Toronto, Ontario, Canada](wp:Toronto "wikilink"), as one
of several Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings occurring in
conjunction with the 16th annual Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology Conference ([ISMB 2008](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2008/)).

Overview
========

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
[Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink") (O|B|F), a non-profit
group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development within the biological research community. Many Open
Source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research community
across many application areas and form a cornerstone in enabling
research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source bioinformatics
software has facilitated rapid innovation and dissemination of new
computational methods as well as informatics infrastructure. Since the
work of the Open Source Bioinformatics Community represents some of the
most cutting edge of Bioinformatics in general, the overall theme for
the conference this year is "Tackling Hard Problems with Emerging
Technologies". Topics under this umbrella include cyberinfrastructure,
grid computing and workflow management and discovery, and visualization.
We will also have a series of update talks about the main Open Source
Bioinformatics Software suites.

One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming together of the open source
developer community in one location. A face-to-face meeting of this
community creates synergy where participants can work together to create
use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for developers from
other projects as short, informal, and hands-on tutorials in new
software packages and emerging technologies. In short, BOSC is not just
a conference for presentations of completed work, but is a dynamic
meeting where collaborative work gets done.

Important Dates
===============

March 10: Call for speakers and abstracts is open.

May 11: Abstract submission deadline. All abstracts must be submitted
through our [Open Conference
Systems](http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2008/openconf.php) site.

Call for Speakers and Abstracts
===============================

Abstract submissions have opened as of Monday, March 10.

All abstracts must be submitted through our [Open Conference
Systems](http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2008/openconf.php) site. Unlike
previous years, submissions by e-mail will not be accepted.

Session Topics
--------------

This year, BOSC is accepting abstract submissions on the conference
theme "Tackling Hard Problems with Emerging Technologies". The
conference theme reflects that there are new technologies emerging on
both the scientific front (new sequencing technologies, etc.) and the IT
front (workflows, mash-up, web 2.0, improvements in all of the major
programming languages, etc.), which may allow the open source community
to solve problems that were previously intractable. Abstracts may be
submitted for the following topics.

**1. Cyberinfrastructure** - This includes topics such as, software
re-use and interoperability infrastructure, data modeling, technologies
commonly referred to under the Web 2.0 paradigm (e.g., folksonomies,
user-based content generation, content feeds, aggregation), peer-to-peer
computing, zeroconf, web-services.

**2. Grid Computing and Workflow Management and Discovery** - We
particularly invite talks that report progress in making workflow
systems easier to use and on how to do distributed-collaborative
research , e.g. workflows that encompass the coordination of systems
running in different parts of the world.

**3. Visualization** - Visualization is a maturing area of open source
software development. We particularly invite talks that demonstrate
innovative visualization systems in the context of workflows.

**4. Open Source Software** - Speakers will present talks on the use,
development, or philosophy of open source software in bioinformatics.

**5. Bio\* Open Source Project Updates** - We invite abstracts from the
representatives of the open source projects sponsored by or affiliated
to the O|B|F (see [Projects](Projects "wikilink")).

Notes on Submissions
--------------------

### Open Source License Requirement

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which is the sole
sponsor of BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy
of Open Source Software Development within the Biological Research
Community. For this reason, in order to be considered for acceptance,
any talk submitted to be presented at BOSC which concerns a specific
software system to be used by the research community must be licensed
with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download by
anyone using ftp, cvs/subversion, or as a tar/zip file from the Project
Website.

See the following websites for further details:

-   [Recognized Open Source
    Licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/)
-   [Definition of the Open Source
    Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)

### How Do I Submit?

Abstract submissions will not be accepted via e-mail this year. All
abstracts must be submitted through our [Open Conference
Systems](http://events.open-bio.org/BOSC2008/openconf.php) site.

You will need to prepare a short, 50-word abstract, and a full abstract
to upload as a PDF file or plain text file.

The deadline for submissions is May 11, 2008.
