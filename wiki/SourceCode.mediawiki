This server has been set up to provide anonymous CVS access to the source code repositories belonging to the Open Bioinformatics Foundation. You can find the "real" project websites by following the links at the top of this page.

How to browse our code repositories via the web:

Go to: http://cvs.open-bio.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi

How to anonymously download code direct from our CVS repositories:

(1) Make sure that CVS is installed on your system.

(2) Pick the repository that you wish to use

    * /home/repository/biopython
    * /home/repository/biojava
    * /home/repository/bioperl
    * /home/repository/biodas
    * /home/repository/moby
    * /home/repository/biocorba
    * /home/repository/biosql
    * /home/repository/bioruby
    * /home/repository/emboss
    * /home/repository/obf-common 

(3) Use the following command (all on one line) to login to the server.

The example below shows how to login to the bioperl repository. To login to other repositories simply alter the /home/repository/(project) information.

    cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.open-bio.org:/home/repository/bioperl login
    when prompted, the password is 'cvs'


(4) Each project CVS repository can have many different packages available for download. You may need to browse the web interface for a bit to determine the packages of interest. After a successful login you may "checkout" the project package you are interested in.

The following command should be executed as one line. The specific example shows how to check out the primary bioperl codebase which is contained in the "bioperl-live" package.

    cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.open-bio.org:/home/repository/bioperl checkout bioperl-live

The login and checkout procedure should only have to be done once. To update the source directories in the future it should be possible just to enter the top level directory and issue the following command:

    cvs update
