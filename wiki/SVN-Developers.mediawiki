= SVN repository access for developers =

This page is for open-bio affiliated developers who are making use of SVN based version control systems rather than the traditional CVS based systems. 

== Access methods ==
=== svnserve operates in tunnel mode only ===
For security and access control reasons we are not running a daemonized svnserver process or allowing access via HTTP through the Apache mod_DAV/svn module methods. The SVN access method that fits best with our current developer and security model is to run svnserver in "tunnel" mode on a per-user basis. This means developers will connect and authenticate via encrypted SSH sessions before svnserver is invoked. In this scenario svnserver is launched in tunnel mode and runs <em>as the user who invoked it</em>.

=== Public SVN Access ==

Not implemented yet. We will set up a standalone anonymous SVN server for public read-only access to hosted repositories. It will function the same way that http://code.open-bio.org currently provides anonymous CVS and RSYNC access to the public. It is highly likely, in fact, that when we deploy public SVN access it will be via http://code.open-bio.org.

== Hosted repositories ==
=== blipkit ===
Blipkit developer access is achieved only via an SSH tunnel:
<pre>
svn checkout svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/blipkit
</pre>
