= SVN repository access for developers =

This page is for open-bio affiliated developers who are making use of SVN based version control systems rather than the traditional CVS based systems. 

== Access methods ==
=== svnserve operates in tunnel mode only ===
For security and access control reasons we are not running a daemonized svnserver process or allowing access via HTTP through the Apache mod_DAV/svn module methods. The SVN access method that fits best with our current developer and security model is to run svnserver in "tunnel" mode on a per-user basis. This means developers will connect and authenticate via encrypted SSH sessions before svnserver is invoked. In this scenario svnserver is launched in tunnel mode and runs <em>as the user who invoked it</em>.

The SVN client protocol makes <b>multiple</b> connections to the svnserver binary. Since we only allow access via SSH this means you may be prompted for you developer password <b>several times</b> during some SVN actions, including  <tt>update</tt>, <tt>diff</tt> (over revisions), and <tt>merge</tt>. The easiest way to circumvent having to enter your password multiple times is to set up your ssh-agent process or make use of SSH keypairs for passwordless access via public key encryption. For assistance in setting this up, email the OBF Helpdesk at <em>support at open-bio.org</em>.

=== Public SVN Access ===

Partially implemented at this time, we now have a web based SVN viewer installed:

http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/

Methods for anonymously checking out SVN repositories are still being worked on. It is highly likely, in fact, that when we deploy public SVN access it will be via http://code.open-bio.org.

== Hosted repositories ==
=== blipkit ===
Blipkit developer access is achieved only via an SSH tunnel:
<pre>
svn checkout svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/blipkit/trunk blipkit
</pre>
