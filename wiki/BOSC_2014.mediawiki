== Important Dates ==

* July 9-10, 2014: [[Codefest 2014]], Boston, MA
* July 11-12, 2014: BOSC 2014, Boston, MA
* July 12-16, 2014: [http://www.iscb.org/ismb2014 ISMB 2014], Boston, MA
* September 18-19, 2014: [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/EU-Codefest_2014 EU-Codefest 2014], Cambridge, UK

== Overview ==

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is run as a two-day meeting before the annual ISMB conference. It is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community. 

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for well over a decade. When the first BOSC (Bioinformatics Open Source Conference) was held in 2000, there were already a number of popular open source bioinformatics packages, and the number and range of these projects has increased dramatically since then.  covers the wide range of open source bioinformatics software being developed, and encompasses the growing movement of Open Science, with its focus on transparency, reproducibility, and data provenance.  We welcome submissions relating to all aspects of bioinformatics and open science software, including new computational methods, reusable software components, visualization, interoperability, and other approaches that help to advance research in the biomolecular sciences. Two full days of talks, posters, panel discussions, and informal discussion groups will enable BOSC attendees to interact with other developers and share ideas and code, as well as learning about some of the latest developments in the field of open source bioinformatics.

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC follow @OBF_BOSC] and use [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BOSC2014 hash tag #bosc2014].

== Registration ==

Because BOSC is run as a two-day Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting at the annual ISMB conference, [https://www.iscb.org/ismb2014-registration registration is via ISMB 2014]. You can attend just BOSC, or combine this with attending the full ISMB conference as well.

Note that this year we have [http://news.open-bio.org/news/2014/03/free-student-presenters-bosc-2014/ waived the BOSC registration fee for student presenters of full-length talks].

If you need a formal invitation letter for your USA VISA application, please contact the ISMB: https://www.iscb.org/ismb2014-registration#visainvitation

== Sponsors ==

BOSC is organised by the [[Main_Page|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

We thank [http://www.eaglegenomics.com/ Eagle Genomics] for sponsoring the BOSC Student Travel Awards again this year, and welcome the open access journal [http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/ GigaScience], and [http://curoverse.com Curoverse] (the team behind the open source platform [http://arvados.org Arvados]) as new sponsors for BOSC 2014.

We are grateful to [http://www.google.com/ Google] for their generous support for videorecording BOSC 2014.

== Session Topics == 
* '''Open Science and Reproducible Research''' -- covers the theory and practice of open science, including open notebook science, open data, transparent and reproducible workflows, and shared standards for reviewing and publishing research papers.
* '''Software Interoperability''' -- includes Open Source approaches to integrating the latest bioinformatics tools, exploring how we can increase tool connectivity and help communities work better together.
* '''Genome-scale Data and Beyond''' -- encompasses software and other tools designed for managing, exploring, and analyzing large-scale data to address research questions, such as genome assembly, variant prediction, eQTL analysis, phylogenomics, and epigenetics.
* '''Visualization''' -- focuses on approaches for interactive as well as static visual representations of biomedical data, ranging from exploration to explanation.
* '''Translational Bioinformatics''' -- explores applications of biological and medical informatics to the development of personalized healthcare, therapies, and a better understanding of human health and disease. Topics include the analysis of large scale population and family sequencing data, bioinformatics methodologies for clinical research, and tools for discovering clinically useful associations in human databases.
* '''Bioinformatics Open Source Project Updates''' -- features short talks from ongoing projects describing their recent progress. Abstracts will be solicited from open source projects affiliated with the O|B|F (see http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects), including the Bio* projects, DAS, BioMOBY, EMBOSS, and GMOD, but any other open-source project will be equally eligible to submit abstracts for this session.
* '''Panel''': Reproducibility: Rewards and Challenges

== Keynote Speakers ==
This year's keynote speakers will be Philip Bourne (NIH) and C. Titus Brown (Michigan State University).
