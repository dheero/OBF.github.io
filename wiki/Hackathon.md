Hacking marathons (Hackathons) or coding festivals
([Codefests](Codefest "wikilink")) are informal meetings focused on
hands on programming and coding, with in person collaboration
potentially allowing much more rapid discussion than remote discussion
by email or IRC. OBF Hackathons have focused on collaborative coding,
documentation, and better interoperation between OBF and other
bioinformatics open-source projects.

OBF Codefests and Hackathons
----------------------------

Since 2010, people from the O|B|F project communities have regularly
organized or co-organized short 2-3 day events preceding the [BOSC
conference](BOSC "wikilink").

    -   Sponsored by Apple Asia
    -   This gathering focused more on [BioSQL](BioSQL "wikilink") and
        [OBDA](bp:OBDA "wikilink") as well as several supporting
        projects from the different toolkits.
