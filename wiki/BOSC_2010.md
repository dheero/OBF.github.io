BOSC 2010 is currently in the planning stages. It will be held for 2
days in conjunction with [the 18th Annual International Conference on
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB
2010)](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2010) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The
dates of BOSC 2009 are July 9-10; the main ISMB/ECCB Conference runs
July 11-13, 2010.

Please see [past BOSC conferences](Past_BOSC_conferences "wikilink") for
the previous 10 conferences.

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly
apply to their own work.

Open Source License Requirement
-------------------------------

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which is the sole
sponsor of BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy
of Open Source Software Development within the biological research
community. For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a
specific software system for use by the research community, then that
software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be
available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file
accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control
system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.
