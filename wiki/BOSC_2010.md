Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly
apply to their own work.

Keynote Speakers
----------------

### Guy Coates

[Guy Coates](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/guy-coates/3/b5b/9b0), Group
leader of the Informatics Systems Group at the [Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/), will be one of our keynote
speakers at BOSC 2010. Guy Coates is an expert in large Linux/Unix
systems architecture, management and application optimization, next-gen
DNA sequencing pipelines, very large database systems (&gt;50TB), and
high performance compute clusters (1500+ CPUs). He will lead off the
conference, with a talk entitled:

***Clouds: all fluff and no substance?*** Cloud architectures have made
plenty of impact in the press over the past 18 months, but have they
made any impact in solving real bioinformatics challenges? This talk
will detail the Sanger Institute's experiences with the cloud, both good
and bad, and ask what needs to be done to prepare the cloud for the era
of commodity sequencing and $500 genomes.

### Ross Gardler

Our other keynote speaker will be [Ross
Gardler](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossgardler), Vice President for
Community Development at the Apache Software Foundation and Manager for
OSS Watch (University of Oxford), which helps institutions and projects
in the UK that are using or developing free and open source software. He
has also performed Computer Science and Management research and teaching
in both the UK and West Indies. Ross will be giving a talk entitled:

***Community Development at the Apache Software Foundation*** The Apache
Software Foundation is home to over 100 projects including the famous
Apache Web Server. In this talk Ross will discuss how the foundation was
created, how ASF projects are managed and how the foundation has scaled
from a community of 12 developers to over 3000 active committers and
hundreds of thousands of active contributors. Finally Ross will look at
new moves to help scale the foundation even further.

Call for Lightning Talks/Birds of a Feather Sessions
----------------------------------------------------

### Lightning Talks and Software Demonstrations

<s>The program committee is currently seeking speakers for the lightning
talks.</s> ***Call for Lightning Talks is now closed.*** Lightning talks
are quick - only five minutes long - and a great opportunity for you to
give people a quick summary of your open source project, code, idea, or
vision of the future. Or, if you are involved in the development of
novel Open Source Software, you could use the time to give a quick
demonstration of your work.

If you are interested in giving a Lightning Talk or Software
Demonstration at BOSC 2010, please e-mail us at <bosc@open-bio.org>:

-   a brief title and summary (one or two lines)
-   a URL for the project page and code
-   the specific open source license used for your software (NOTE: the [
    Open Source License
    Requirement](BOSC_2010#Open_Source_License_Requirement "wikilink")
    also applies to Lightning talks).

### Birds of a Feather Sessions

One of the more popular activities at BOSC are the Birds-of-a-Feather
sub-meetings that people organize at the end of each days session. These
are free-form meetings organized by the attendees themselves.
Traditionally, some BOF's have been formed to allow developers and users
of individual [OBF](OBF "wikilink") software to meet each other
face-to-face to discuss the project, but other meetings have been formed
to discuss completely new ideas. These meetings offer a unique
opportunity for individuals to explore more about the activities of the
various Open Source Projects, and, in some cases, even take an active
role influencing the future of Open Source Software development. If you
would like to create a BOF, just sign up for a [ wiki
account](Special:Userlogin "wikilink"), login, and edit the [ BOSC 2010
Birds of a Feather](BOSC_2010/Birds-of-a-Feather "wikilink") page.

Sessions
--------

-   **OpenBio [SolutionChallenge](SolutionChallenge "wikilink")** --
    Bioinformatics library providers: please join us in a friendly
    competition to solve a shared biological problem, demonstrating the
    utility of your toolkit alongside other developers.
    -   Instead of the traditional Bio\* updates that we've had at
        previous conferences, this year, we're planning to organize
        these talks around a central theme: the OpenBio
        Solution Challenge. We start with a biological question of
        general interest, and the project talks will focus around how
        you would solve that problem using your toolkit and
        programming language.
    -   This is meant to provide a challenge for OpenBio contributors, a
        nice tutorial style overview of various projects and approaches
        for other programmers, and a fun opportunity to compete and
        learn from other projects. Conference attendees will vote on
        their favorite solution, with the winner receiving fame and
        fortune (warning: fortune not guaranteed).
    -   Specific challenges are being discussed on the
        [SolutionChallenge](SolutionChallenge "wikilink") page and
        through the various Bio\* mailing lists. Alternately, each
        project could highlight a challenge that they particularly do
        well, focusing tutorial-style on how to solve a
        particular problem.
    -   (Of course, we would still welcome traditional Bio\* Update
        abstracts, too!)
-   **Approaches to analyzing high-throughput 'omics data** --
    Presentation of projects that use the MapReduce framework either for
    1.  parallelized analysis of possibly terabyte size data sets from
        next-gen sequencing and mass spec proteomics or
    2.  parallelization of bioinformatics algorithms in general (e.g.,
        the Apache Mahout project).

  
Projects may involve Hadoop (MapReduce API + HDFS) as well as associated
open source toolkits (Hbase, Hive, Pig, Cascading, etc.) or other NoSQL
non-relational data stores.

-   **Cloud-based approaches to improving software and data
    accessibility** -- The emergence of [cloud
    computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) has made
    highly scalable cluster computing available to
    computational biologists. Services such as [Amazon Elastic Compute
    Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) combined with [publicly available
    datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/#1) promise to lower
    the overhead to participate in large scale data analyses. We are
    interested in talks focused around how the community can build up
    resources and datasets for cloud infrastructure, as well as the
    sharing of insights, and the contribution of implemented workflows.
    Current implementations and initiatives are encouraged to submit
    abstracts for talks and join in the pre-conference [Codefest
    session](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2010).
-   **The Semantic Web in open source bioinformatics** -- Emerging
    [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
    technologies promise to improve data interoperability
    and accessibility. Seeing these developments as promising for life
    science researchers who struggle daily with new file formats and
    incompatible datasets, [BioHackathon
    2010](http://hackathon3.dbcls.jp/) focused around current semantic
    resources and tools for bioinformatics. We solicit session talks
    from researchers using RDF and related technologies in their
    research and data analyses, with a special focus on documenting how
    these tools can contribute to open data access.
-   **Open Source Software** -- Open source software that does not fit
    neatly into the above categories.
-   **Lightning Talks** -- short, 5 minute talks intended to introduce
    very recent developments, initiate discussion, or highlight
    resources of interest to BOSC attendees. Abstracts for Lightning
    Talks will be accepted up to the first day of BOSC and will be
    accepted based on space availability and conformance to the Open
    Source License Requirement.

Student Travel Awards
---------------------

Through generous sponsorship from [Eagle
Genomics](http://www.eaglegenomics.com/) and an anonymous donor, we are
