Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly
apply to their own work.

Keynote Speakers
----------------

### Guy Coates

[Guy Coates](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/guy-coates/3/b5b/9b0), Group
leader of the Informatics Systems Group at the [Wellome Trust Sanger
Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/), will be one of our keynote
speakers at BOSC 2010. Guy Coates is an expert in large Linux/Unix
systems architecture, management and application optimization, next-gen
DNA sequencing pipelines, very large database systems (&gt;50TB), and
high performance compute clusters (1500+ CPUs). He will lead off the
conference, with a talk entitled:

***Clouds: all fluff and no substance?*** Cloud architectures have made
plenty of impact in the press over the past 18 months, but have they
made any impact in solving real bioinformatics challenges? This talk
will detail the Sanger Institute's experiences with the cloud, both good
and bad, and ask what needs to be done to prepare the cloud for the era
of commodity sequencing and $500 genomes.

### Ross Gardler

Our other keynote speaker will be [Ross
Gardler](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossgardler), Vice President for
Community Development at the Apache Software Foundation and Manager for
OSS Watch (University of Oxford), which helps institutions and projects
in the UK that are using or developing free and open source software. He
has also performed Computer Science and Management research and teaching
in both the UK and West Indies. In his talk, he will share with the
O|B|F community the insights he has gained in community building for
Apache and other open source projects.

Sessions
--------

-   **OpenBio [SolutionChallenge](SolutionChallenge "wikilink")** --
    Bioinformatics library providers: please join us in a friendly
    competition to solve a shared biological problem, demonstrating the
    utility of your toolkit alongside other developers.
    -   Instead of the traditional Bio\* updates that we've had at
        previous conferences, this year, we're planning to organize
        these talks around a central theme: the OpenBio
        Solution Challenge. We start with a biological question of
        general interest, and the project talks will focus around how
        you would solve that problem using your toolkit and
        programming language.
    -   This is meant to provide a challenge for OpenBio contributors, a
        nice tutorial style overview of various projects and approaches
        for other programmers, and a fun opportunity to compete and
        learn from other projects. Conference attendees will vote on
        their favorite solution, with the winner receiving fame and
        fortune (warning: fortune not guaranteed).
    -   Specific challenges are being discussed on the
        [SolutionChallenge](SolutionChallenge "wikilink") page and
        through the various Bio\* mailing lists. Alternately, each
        project could highlight a challenge that they particularly do
        well, focusing tutorial-style on how to solve a
        particular problem.
    -   (Of course, we would still welcome traditional Bio\* Update
        abstracts, too!)
-   **Approaches to analyzing high-throughput 'omics data** --
    Presentation of projects that use the MapReduce framework either for
    1.  parallelized analysis of possibly terabyte size data sets from
        next-gen sequencing and mass spec proteomics or
    2.  parallelization of bioinformatics algorithms in general (e.g.,
        the Apache Mahout project).

  
Projects may involve Hadoop (MapReduce API + HDFS) as well as associated
open source toolkits (Hbase, Hive, Pig, Cascading, etc.) or other NoSQL
non-relational data stores.

-   **Cloud-based approaches to improving software and data
    accessibility** -- The emergence of [cloud
    computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) has made
    highly scalable cluster computing available to
    computational biologists. Services such as [Amazon Elastic Compute
    Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) combined with [publicly available
    datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/#1) promise to lower
    the overhead to participate in large scale data analyses. We are
    interested in talks focused around how the community can build up
    resources and datasets for cloud infrastructure, as well as the
    sharing of insights, and the contribution of implemented workflows.
    Current implementations and initiatives are encouraged to submit
    abstracts for talks and join in the pre-conference [Codefest
    session](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2010).
-   **The Semantic Web in open source bioinformatics** -- Emerging
    [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
    technologies promise to improve data interoperability
    and accessibility. Seeing these developments as promising for life
    science researchers who struggle daily with new file formats and
    incompatible datasets, [BioHackathon
    2010](http://hackathon3.dbcls.jp/) focused around current semantic
    resources and tools for bioinformatics. We solicit session talks
    from researchers using RDF and related technologies in their
    research and data analyses, with a special focus on documenting how
    these tools can contribute to open data access.
-   **Open Source Software** -- Open source software that does not fit
    neatly into the above categories.
-   **Lightning Talks** -- short, 5 minute talks intended to introduce
    very recent developments, initiate discussion, or highlight
    resources of interest to BOSC attendees. Abstracts for Lightning
    Talks will be accepted up to the first day of BOSC and will be
    accepted based on space availability and conformance to the Open
    Source License Requirement.
