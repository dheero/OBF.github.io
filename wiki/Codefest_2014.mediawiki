OpenBio Codefest 2014 will take place July 9th and 10th, 2014 (the Wednesday and
Thursday before [[BOSC 2014]]) in Cambridge, Massachusetts at
[http://www.hackreduce.org/ hack/reduce]. This is a great opportunity for open
source bioinformatics developers to meet and work collaboratively. We hope to
have developers from projects such as [http://bioperl.org BioPerl],
[http://www.biojava.org BioJava], [http://biopython.org Biopython],
[http://www.bioruby.org BioRuby], [http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/ Galaxy] and
[http://www.genomespace.org GenomeSpace] in attendance. Everyone is welcome to
attend.

This is the fifth annual [[Codefest]], continuing work from [[Codefest 2010]] in
Boston, [[Codefest 2011]] in Vienna, [[Codefest 2012]] in Los Angeles, and
[[Codefest 2013]] in Berlin.

== Goals ==

Most open source bioinformatics projects are coordinated remotely, with users
from all over the world contributing and organizing themselves through mailing
lists and chats. Contributors work on these projects in their spare time,
balancing open source commitments with their day jobs and life outside of the computer.

The objective of the Codefest is to give these talented developers a chance to
be fully focused on the projects for a few days, interacting in real
time. Previous [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Hackathon Hackathons] have been
immensely successful at producing new high quality code and innovative project
developments.

The goals for the two days are determined entirely by attendees. Please add your
project ideas to the
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yADE2bb0rEU6TASxuSPsvTdHvh_rtCXzJrsL3NWzxXE/edit?usp=sharing shared Google document].
We'll use this brainstorming discussion document to prepare directions for the
two days of work.
