===About Us===

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation or O|B|F is a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of [[wp:open source|Open Source]] software development and [[wp:Open science|Open Science]] within the biological research community.

Our main activities are:

* Running and supporting the [[BOSC]] conferences.
* Organizing and supporting developer-centric "[[Hackathon]]" events.
* [[Google Summer of Code| Participating in the Google Summer of Code program]] on behalf of our [[Projects| member projects]] as an umbrella mentoring organization.
* Managing our servers, colocation facilities, bank account, domain names, and other assets.
* Public opinion and policy statements about matters related to Open Source and Open Science in bioinformatics.

As of October 12, 2012, the O|B|F is a [http://www.spi-inc.org Software in the Public Interest, Inc.] (SPI) associated project.
* [[:File:OBF-Bylaws.pdf| Our bylaws]], with the [https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/8 changes] approved on Sep 11, 2012.

=== History ===

O|B|F grew out of the volunteer projects [[BioPerl]], [[BioJava]] and [[Biopython]] and was formally incorporated in 2001 in order to handle our modest requirements of hardware ownership, domain name management and funding for conferences and workshops. The Foundation does not participate directly in the development or structure of the open source work, but as the members of the foundation are drawn from our projects' developer communities, there is clear commonality of direction and purpose.

===BOSC===
The [[BOSC 2012|Bioinformatics Open Source Conference]] (BOSC) is held annually in conjunction with [http://www.iscb.org ISCB's] meeting, ISMB.  [[BOSC 2013]] will take place July 17-18, right before [http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013 ISMB/ECCB 2013] in Berlin, Germany.
