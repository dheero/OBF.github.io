title: Unavailable Search Open Bio Org

Apologies for the inconvenience. We are in the process of migrating all
of our mailing lists, servers, sites and services onto new hardware
located in a new datacenter. During the transition our search site
(http://search.open-bio.org) has lost most of its functionality due to
the shifting location of the content we wish to index and make
searchable.

Once the migration is complete and all our websites, mailing list and
mailing list archives are in their new (and stable!) locations we will
rebuild and reactivate the <http://search.open-bio.org> service.

Questions or comments can be sent to 'root-l@open-bio.org'
