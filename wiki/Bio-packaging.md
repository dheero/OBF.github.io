title: Bio-packaging
---

If you are in any way interested in software packaging and deployment
for bioinformatics you can meet like-minded people on the Open
Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) bio-packaging mailing list at

`   `[`http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/bio-packaging`](http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/bio-packaging)

Here we discuss issues around packaging and deploying software: anything
that concerns dependencies, multiple version support and/or
reproducibility. The general idea is to come up with solutions we can
share across environments and construct (shared) pipelines out of them.

Generic packaging systems
-------------------------

### GNU Guix

[GNU guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix) is a package manager for
the Gnu/Linux operating system. Bioinformatics packages are constructed
[here](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/packages/bioinformatics.scm).

Language based packaging systems
--------------------------------

### Ruby biogems

-   Biogems: <http://biogems.info/>

### Python packages

### Perl CPAN

### R CRAN

-   <http://cran.r-project.org/>

### Javascript

-   node.js npm: <https://www.npmjs.com>
-   javascript, bower: <http://bower.io>

Linux distributions and VMs
---------------------------

### Debian Med

[Debian Med](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/) contains a wide
range of software packages target at Debian Linux and derivatives.

### CloudBiolinux

### Galaxy

### Docker
