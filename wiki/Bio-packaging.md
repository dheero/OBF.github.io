title: Bio-packaging

If you are in any way interested in software packaging and deployment
for bioinformatics you can meet like-minded people on the Open
Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) bio-packaging mailing list at

`   `[`http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/bio-packaging`](http://lists.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/bio-packaging)

Here we discuss issues around packaging and deploying software: anything
that concerns dependencies, multiple version support and/or
reproducibility. The general idea is to come up with solutions we can
share across environments and construct (shared) pipelines out of them.
