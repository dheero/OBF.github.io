The 12th Annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) 2011 will
be held immediately before the 19th Annual [International Conference on
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB
2011)](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2011) at the Austria Center in
Vienna, Austria. The dates of BOSC 2011 are July 15-16; the main ISMB
Conference runs July 17-19,2 011. There will also be a Hackathon before
BOSC (date and location TB).

[BOSC 2010](BOSC_2010 "wikilink") was held in Boston, MA, from July
9-10. Selected, peer-reviewed papers from BOSC 2010 will published in
[BMC Bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/).

The deadline for [ submitting
abstracts](BOSC_2011#Abstract_Submission_Information "wikilink") is
April 18, 2011.

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly
apply to their own work.
