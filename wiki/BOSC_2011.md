![The Bosc Pear](Pear.png "The Bosc Pear")

The 12th Annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2011) will
be held immediately before the 19th Annual [International Conference on
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB
2011)](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2011) at the Austria Center in
Vienna, Austria. BOSC 2011 will take place July 15-16; the main ISMB
Conference will be July 17-19, 2011. Participants are also invited to
[Codefest 2011](Codefest_2011 "wikilink"), July 13-14.

The preliminary [BOSC 2011 Schedule](BOSC_2011_Schedule "wikilink") is
now up.

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or ongoing developments that they can directly apply
to their own work.

Please spread the word about BOSC to interested developers; all are
welcome. On Twitter, we recommend the hash tag \#bosc2011.

[BOSC 2010](BOSC_2010 "wikilink") was held in Boston, MA, from July
9-10. Selected peer-reviewed papers from BOSC 2010 were be published in
[BMC
Bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11?issue=S12) on
21 December, 2010.

Keynote Speakers
----------------

### Lawrence Hunter

Lawrence Hunter is Professor of Pharmacology and Computer Science at the
University of Colorado and director of the Computational Bioscience
Program at the School of Medicine. He is one of the founders of ISMB, a
fellow of the ISCB, and is well known for contributions in a broad range
of problems in computational biology.

Dr. Hunter will be giving a talk entitled *The role of openness in
knowledge-based systems for biomedicine.* Knowledge-based approaches to
the analysis to genome-scale data require the extraction, sharing and
use of very large amounts of knowledge about biomedicine. Developments
such as the open source software movement, the Open Biomedical
Ontologies, Semantic Web standards such as OWL and SPARQL, and the
spread of open access publishing are creating the potential for powerful
knowledge-based computer systems that may play an important role in the
future of biomedical research. Yet several critical challenges remain
before this vision can be realized. Dr. Hunter will discuss some
relevant recent resources developed in my lab, some of the
socio-political barriers that remain, and what you can do to overcome
them.

### Matt Wood

As the Technology Evangelist for Amazon Web Services, Matt discusses the
technical and organisational aspects of cloud computing across the
world. With a background in the life sciences, Matt is interested in
helping teams of all sizes bring their ideas to life through technology.
Before joining Amazon he built web-scale search engines at Cornell
University, sequenced DNA in Hinxton and developed scientific software
in Cambridge. He is a frequent speaker at international conferences, a
blogger, published author and an advocate of research productivity.

Matt's talk, entitled *Into the Wonderful*, will feature a discussion of
the constraints of working with the size, scope and complexity of modern
research data, and how cloud computing can help accelerate academic
research. We'll take a look at the current state of the art, the role
cloud computing plays in increasing the impact of open source tools, the
use of public hosted data in the cloud and how academic cloud platforms
can help promote collaboration, reproducibility and reuse across
disciplines.

### Open Source License Requirement

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which sponsors
BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open
Source Software Development within the biological research community.
For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a specific
software system for use by the research community, then that software
must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available
for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through
ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like
cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.

See the following websites for further information:

    Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)

Sessions
--------

-   **Approaches to parallel processing** -- This session will cover
    data-parallel approaches to analyzing the massive data sets from
    next-generation sequencing and mass spec proteomics, or reports on
    the parallelization of bioinformatics algorithms in general.
-   **Cloud-based approaches to improving software and data
    accessibility** -- The emergence of [cloud
    computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) has made
    highly scalable cluster computing available to
    computational biologists. Services such as [Amazon Elastic Compute
    Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) combined with [publicly available
    datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/#1) promise to lower
    the overhead to participate in large scale data analyses. Talks will
    focus on how the community can build up resources and datasets for
    cloud infrastructure, as well as the sharing of insights, and the
    contribution of implemented workflows.
-   **The Semantic Web in open source bioinformatics** -- Existing
    databases such as UniProt are now being made fully available in
    [RDF](http://dev.isb-sib.ch/projects/uniprot-rdf/) format, and new
    repositories such as [Bio2RDF](http://bio2rdf.org/) are being built
    upon RDF and are allowing RDF-based query language use
    (e.g., SPARQL). This session is devoted to reports on software that
    works with such new data stores, or aids in their development, as
    well as descriptions of software that pertains to ontology building
    or maintenance. We also solicit talks about projects that employ
    information management architectures/frameworks such as UIMA, an
    open source project in Apache Incubator status, that facilitate
    integration of semantic analysis and search components.
-   **Genome content management** -- Processes and technologies that
    support the creating, managing and reporting of genomic data. This
    session is appropriate for discussion of systems that involve
    components such as (but not limited to) Ensembl and GMOD/Chado data
    stores, Taverna and Galaxy analysis workflows, and BioMart and
    InterMine warehouses.
-   **Data visualization**-- Approaches to presenting large biomedical
    datasets with visual aids that make the data easier to understand
    and analyze.
-   **Tools for next-generation sequencing** -- Practical approaches to
    analyzing next generation sequencing data, focusing on flexible
    tools that combine existing software and algorithms.
-   **Open Source Software** -- Open source bioinformatics software that
    does not fit neatly into the above categories.
-   **Meeting the challenges of inter-institutional collaboration**
    (panel discussion) -- Many open source projects involve
    collaborators from organizations all over the world. Participants in
    this panel discussion will comment on how their projects have dealt
    with the challenges that arise from these
    multi-institution collaborations.
-   **Poster session** -- This year, BOSC attendees will have the
    opportunity to present posters about their work. For information
    about submitting a poster abstract, [please refer to the section on
    Abstract Submission
    Information](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2011#Abstract_Submission_Information).
