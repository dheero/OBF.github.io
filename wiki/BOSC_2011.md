The 12th Annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2011) will
be held immediately before the 19th Annual [International Conference on
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB
2011)](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2011) at the Austria Center in
Vienna, Austria. The dates of BOSC 2011 are July 15-16; the main ISMB
Conference runs July 17-19, 2011. There will also be a CodeFest before
BOSC (date and location TBA).

The deadline for [ submitting
abstracts](BOSC_2011#Abstract_Submission_Information "wikilink") is
April 18, 2011.

Overview
--------

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is sponsored by the
Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to
promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software
development within the biological research community.

Many open source bioinformatics packages are widely used by the research
community across many application areas and form a cornerstone in
enabling research in the genomic and post-genomic era. Open source
bioinformatics software has facilitated rapid innovation, dissemination,
and wide adoption of new computational methods, reusable software
components, and standards. One of the hallmarks of BOSC is the coming
together of the open source developer community in one location to meet
face-to-face. This creates synergy where participants can work together
to create use cases, prototype working code, or run bootcamps for
developers from other projects as short, informal, and hands-on
tutorials in new software packages and emerging technologies. In short,
BOSC is not just a conference for presentations of completed work, but
is a dynamic meeting where collaborative work gets done and attendees
can learn about new or on-going developments that they can directly
apply to their own work.

[BOSC 2010](BOSC_2010 "wikilink") was held in Boston, MA, from July
9-10. Selected peer-reviewed papers from BOSC 2010 will be published in
[BMC Bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/).

Abstract Submission Information
-------------------------------

The deadline for abstract submissions is Monday, April 18, 2011.

Abstracts must be **one page** in length and submitted **as a PDF file
only**. Please observe the following formatting guidelines:

-   Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom of
    the page.
-   List the following elements in order from the top of the page:
    -   Title
    -   Authors, with the presenting author's name underlined.
    -   Author affiliations, including the e-mail address of the
        presenting author.
    -   URL for the overall project web site
    -   URL for accessing the code
    -   The particular Open Source License being used
-   The abstracts will be presented "as is" in the program booklet;
    please help your all-volunteer Organizing Committee by following the
    formatting guidelines above.
-   **NOTE: upload your one-page, PDF-formatted abstract to the Open
    Conference System site as the *File*.** The text box for the
    *Abstract* is optional; the PDF file is what will be reviewed.

Accepted talks will be 10-20 minutes, depending on the session. You will
be notified of the length of your talk upon abstract acceptance.

Submissions for Lightning Talks (5 minutes) will be accepted up until
the first day of the conference, though submission to the program
following the above guidelines is strongly encouraged to facilitate
better planning. The open-source license requirement (see below) applies
equally to lightning talks.

### Open Source License Requirement

The [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](OBF "wikilink"), which is the sole
sponsor of BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy
of Open Source Software Development within the biological research
community. For this reason, if a submitted talk proposal concerns a
specific software system for use by the research community, then that
software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be
available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file
accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control
system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.

See the following websites for further information:

-   [Recognized Open Source
    Licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/)
-   [Definition of the Open Source
    Philosophy](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php)
