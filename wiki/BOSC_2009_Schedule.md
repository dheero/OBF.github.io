Keynote Speakers
----------------

The BOSC 2009 Organizing committee is pleased to announce our two
Keynote Speakers:

### Alan Ruttenberg

[Alan Ruttenberg](http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/ruttenberg/)
is a Principal Scientist at [Science
Commons](http://sciencecommons.org). He works with Semantic Web
technologies in computational biology, with an emphasis on the creation
and application of structured biological knowledge to interpret
experimental results. He is currently involved in a number of open
biomedical ontology efforts, including: the Ontology for Biomedical
Investigations (OBI), the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) that will form the
upper level ontology for the OBO foundry, the Infectious Disease
Ontology (IDO), the Program on Ontologies of Neural Structures (PONS),
the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), and BioPAX-OBO for representing
molecular and cellular pathways. These interests and efforts come
together in my project at Science Commons - the Neurocommons, a large
scale Semantic Web knowledge base of biological information aimed at
supporting, initially, the neurosciences. He is also an active
participant in W3C Semantic Web activities. In 2006 and 2007 he was a
member of the Health Care Life Sciences Interest Group, and early work
on the Neurocommons became the core of the prototype life sciences
knowledge base that the group has documented. He is a chair of the OWL
Working Group specifying OWL 2, and a coordinating editor of the OBO
Foundry. His graduate work was at the MIT Media Lab in the Music and
Cognition Group, and he has an undergraduate degree in Physics and
Mathematics from Brandeis University.

### Robert S. Hanmer

Robert S. Hanmer is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff in the
Technical Component Management area in Alcatel-Lucent’s Operations area.
He is based in Naperville, Illinois, USA. Current responsibilities
include developing software-sourcing strategies for middleware and open
source software. Previous positions within Lucent and Bell Laboratories
have included development, architecture and evaluation of highly
reliable systems focusing especially on the areas of reliability and
performance. He is active in the software patterns community, including
serving as program chair at several pattern conferences. He has authored
or co-authored 14 journal articles, several book chapters and the book
Patterns for Fault Tolerant Software. He is a member of the IEEE
Computer Society, a Senior Member of the ACM and current President of
[The Hillside Group](http://hillside.net/), the organization that
sponsors the PLoP conference. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in
Computer Science from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
