Open Source, Open Door: increasing diversity in the bioinformatics open source community
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**July 14, 2015: Uduak Grace Thomas wrote a [GenomeWeb article about our
efforts to promote diversity at
BOSC](https://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/bosc-community-discusses-ways-boost-diversity-participation-bioinformatics).**

Every year, BOSC includes a panel discussion that offers all attendees
the chance to engage in conversation with the panelists and each other.
This year, our panel discussion will focus on **increasing diversity in
our community and at our conferences**.

Panel chair **Mónica Muñoz-Torres**
([@monimunozto](https://twitter.com/monimunozto)) is the lead biocurator
at Berkeley Bioinformatics Open-Source Projects (BBOP). She is part of
the development teams for Web Apollo (a web-based annotation editor
designed to support community-based curation of genomes) and the tools
of the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium. She co-leads the Community
Curation group within the global initiative to sequence and annotate the
genomes of 5,000 arthropods (i5K Initiative), and is a member of the
Executive Committee of the International Society for Biocuration (ISB).
As a graduate student, Monica founded the first Southeastern Chapter of
the Society for Advancement of Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans
in Science (SACNAS) at Clemson University; the chapter has since been
actively involved in outreach activities to local high schools in an
attempt to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM. She is currently
working on forming the first professional chapter of SACNAS in the San
Francisco Bay area.

**Holly Bik** ([@hollybik](https://twitter.com/hollybik)) is a
Birmingham Fellow (assistant professor) in the School of Biosciences at
the University of Birmingham, UK. Her research uses high-throughput
environmental sequencing approaches (rRNA surveys, metagenomics) to
explore biodiversity and biogeographic patterns in microbial eukaryote
assemblages, with an emphasis on nematodes in marine sediments. Through
active collaborations with computer scientists and participation in
software development projects, her long-term research aims to address
existing bottlenecks encountered in –Omic analyses focused on microbial
eukaryotes.

**Michael R. Crusoe** ([@biocrusoe](https://twitter.com/biocrusoe)) is
the lead for the k-h-mer project at C. Titus Brown's Lab for Data
Intensive Biology at the University of California, Davis in the School
of Veterinary Medicine. A community-minded bioinformatics research
software engineer and Software Carpentry instructor, he is also a member
of the Debian Med software packaging team. Michael's social justice
background includes a prior seat on the board for the Phoenix, Arizona
chapter of GLSEN, the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network and
he is proud to be a supporter of the Ada Initiative.

**Aleksandra Pawlik**
([@aleksandrana](https://twitter.com/aleksandrana)) is a Training Lead
at the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk/)
at Manchester University, UK. She coordinates training activities and
helps develop strategies and curricula for teaching computational lab
skills to researchers across disciplines at all stages of their research
career. She is a member of the Steering Committees for Data Carpentry
and Software Carpentry Foundation, and supports the development of both
initiatives. Currently, Aleksandra is collaborating on training with the
ELIXIR project supporting the bioinformatics community. As a certified
Software and Data Carpentry instructor Aleksandra has taught at a number
of workshops, including Software Carpentry for Women in Science and
Engineering, which she co-organised.

**Jason Williams**
([@JasonWilliamsNY](https://twitter.com/JasonWilliamsNY)) is the Lead of
the iPlant Collaborative’s Education, Outreach, Training (EOT) group,
based at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he has worked for over 10
years. He is also a Lead Instructor of “The Science Institute” at
Yeshiva University High School for Girls, and the Treasurer of the
Software Carpentry Foundation. His background is in molecular biology
and bioinformatics. Diversity is a focus of Jason's work at the DNA
Learning Center and with iPlant, where he works to target outreach along
the entire spectrum of underrepresented and underserved groups ranging
from minorities in urban communities to first-generation college
students at rural institutions.
