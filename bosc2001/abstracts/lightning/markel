OMG's New Model Driven Architecture and Its Implications for the Life
   Sciences Community

The ability to "plug and play" interoperable software components in the
life sciences domain is of critical importance in today's dynamic
marketplace.  The Object Management Group (OMG) is one source of
emerging standards in the life sciences.  OMG has recently announced a
new Model Driven Architecture (MDA).  This talk will describe platform
independent models (PIMs), platform specific models (PSMs), and discuss
the implications for the life sciences community.  In particular, what
kinds of specifications are likely to result from the new MDA approach
and why does it make sense for the life sciences community to use the
OMG's adoption process?
