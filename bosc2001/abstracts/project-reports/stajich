Subject: biocorba bosc abstract

The BioCORBA project has seen great progress in the last year.  Toolkit
bindings for the latest IDL spec have been written in java, perl, and
python with bindings to each of the bio{*} language projects.
Additionally, an IDL extending from the BioCORBA base objects was
written to describe Ensembl gene and sequence data.  The Ensembl corba
bindings allow users to create a language neutral inteface to the
perl ensembl data layer.  EBI's Industry group has also provided an EMBL
db behind a biocorba layer to permit simplified sequence database access.
