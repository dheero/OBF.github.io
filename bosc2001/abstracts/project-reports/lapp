Bioperl enters maturity and the post-genomics era

Bioperl (http://www.bioperl.org/) is an effort to gather and integrate
Perl modules for diverse bioinformatics and life science research
tasks into one system that is easy-to-use for developers, has a
consistent and common object-oriented API, and is flexible enough to
allow complex systems build on it as a foundation. With its inception
dating back to 1995 Bioperl is one of the oldest bioinformatics open
source projects.
Development activities over the past months resulted in a quantum leap
towards maturity of the system as defined by completeness, stability,
consistency, flexibility, interoperability, and organization of the
project. At the same time, Bioperl together with bioinformatics and
the life sciences stands at the verge of the post-genomics era, with
the focus of active research shifting to structural biology,
transcriptome definition, and pathway identification, to name a few.
In my talk I will center on the roadmap and its implications of Bioperl
towards its imminent declaration of maturity, followed by options for a
future mission in the post-genomics field.
