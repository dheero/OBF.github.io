               Biopython: Status and Plans

Biopython (http://www.biopython.org/) started two years ago
with the goal of bringing together powerful, robust tools
that enable researchers to develop new methods and
applications more quickly than is possible with other
existing systems.  We have based those tools on
Python, which is a very high-level, multi-paradigm
programming language that is readable, easy to learn and is
enjoyable by researchers and software developers.

During the last few years, we have acquired a half dozen
core members, a set of libraries for sequence manipulation
and a graphical sequence editor, web scrapers, BioCORBA
integration, and a high performance parser generator for
bioinformatics formats.  

In my presentation I will describe a few of the design
philosophies in Biopython then present an overview of the
platform by showing a walk-through of how someone might
use it to solve various research problems.  I will end by
outlining some of the current projects and where we
expect to go in the future.
