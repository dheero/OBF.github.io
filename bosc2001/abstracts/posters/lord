Cinema-MX: A modular and configurable alignment editor in Java 2
Phillip Lord, Julian Selley, and Terri Attwood.


Multiple sequence alignments are found in many areas of molecular
biology and bioinformatics. We report the development of an
application "Cinema-MX" for viewing and analysing such alignments. The
application was written using the Java2 language. It is highly
modular, extensible, and configurable, enabling it to be used in a
variety of different specialised circumstances without reducing its
general usefulness. As an example we show the close integration
between Cinema-MX and the PRINTS database.
