      <p align="left" class="blogbody"><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomart">BioMart</a> is a simple, query-oriented 
data integration system based on distributed data warehousing ideas. 
It offers a flexible, fast and practical data-mining framework for 
computer-savvy bioinformaticians as well as life scientists without any 
programming experience. Originally developed as EnsMart for Ensembl, it 
has now been successfuly applied to a variety of biological databases, 
which can be accessed via the web and standalone interfaces. 
<br />
<br />
The BioMart suite consits of a relational database schema specification,
an XML-based configuration system, administration tools for configuring
and deploying BioMart databases, and data access software written in perl
and java. A universal, query-optimised database schema, coupled with 
domain-agnostic software are responsible for the key features of the 
BioMart system: generic applicability, large query network-scalability and 
RDBMS-platform portability. Thus, the system can be readily deployed 
to provide a unified set of query interfaces to datasources residing 
anywhere on the available network. In addition, simultaneous querying of 
multiple data sources spread over any number of servers is supported 
via query-chaining. 
<br />
<br />
BioMart is an OpenSource project and all software is licensed under LGPL.

      <p align="left" class="title">Title: BioMake: Functional Logical Task Management for Bioinformatics</p>
      <p align="left" class="blogbody">A recurring pattern in bioinformatics architectures is the build
pattern, or pipeline. This can be defined as a computational
specification or template defining a collection of interdependent
tasks. Examples include biological sequence analysis pipelines and
data transformation pipelines (import and export of flatfiles, XML and
reports to and from relational databases).
<br />
<br />
Approaches range from the lightweight and generic to heavy duty
frameworks honed specifically for bioinformatics compute pipelines. An
example of the former is UNIX Makefiles, which is a configuration of
tasks where some files must be updated automatically from other files
whenever the other files change, and is primarily used for program
compilation. Examples of the latter include object-oriented systems
such as BioPipe, which are tightly integrated with the BioPerl
library.
<br />
<br />
For our in-house task management we required something similar to
Makefiles in terms of level of abstraction and simplicity, yet without the
limitations of Makefiles and related systems (ant, scons, build, etc). In
particular we needed:
<br />
<br />
 - Asynchrnonous task management on compute farms<br/>
 - Choice of either relational database or filesystem for storing build
targets<br/>
 - A cleaner specification language<br/>
 - Fully programmable logic within the Makefile specification<br />
<br />
<br />
Our solution "BioMake" covers these requirements. It uses a declarative
language based around the concept of <i>skolem functions</i>. Each task in
the pipeline is specified as a function construct; for example, in a
genomic compute pipeline there may be function constructs "blastx(Seq,DB)"
and "genscan(Seq)". Each function construct represents a unique and
persistent identifier for the output of an executable. Functions can be
nested; for example "genscan(repeatmask(gi2177872))" represents the
results of running Genscan on a particular RepeatMasked sequence.
Dependent tasks are also specified as functions, and variable unification
is used as an alternative to Makefile-style pattern matching. Actions can
be parameterized using functions and variables. Functions are evaluated to
locators of the target data; for example, a filesystem path, or primary
key value in a database.
<br />
<br />
The task management engine is implemented in Prolog, and pipeline
specifications can use the Prolog code to provide full
programmability. Prolog is a declarative logic language and is
particularly suited to Makefile-style logic. However, the pipeline
programmer does not need to know Prolog in order to
construct or understand useful protocols.
<br />
<br />
The intention is to allow simple and concise specification of complex
pipelines. BioMake requires no object-oriented programming, and is not
tied to any particular language. We provide example customizable
compute pipelines which utilise standard bioinformatics analysis
programs such as BLAST, and infrastructure programs such as the
Apollo Bop parser, XSLT transforms and scripts using BioPerl.
<br />

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">   Ensembl is a genome information system designed for handling large
genomes, in particular human, mouse and other vertebrates. Its major code
bases can be broken down into three sections: a core relational schema and
API, a computational pipeline system and a user-friendly web site. The
Ensembl system has been designed principally to enable biologists to use
vertebrate genomes, but the source code of Ensembl is open source and
there has been increasing modularisation and clean-up of the system. This
means that Ensembl software has become increasingly useful as toolkit
itself for other genomes: we currently know of at least 8 genomes that
have been loaded and displayed using the Ensembl software outside of the
main Ensembl group.
<br />
<br />
   I will present the aspects of Ensembl which are most open to reuse, in
particular how to load and run a new genome into Ensembl from existing,
flat file annotation, and sense of how to extend Ensembl, either using the
configureable DAS protocol or via schema additions. I will also briefly
outline the main concepts behind the pipeline.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody"><a href="http://sf.net/projects/turnkey">Turnkey </a>is a generic engine for creating a fully functional website automatically.  The project uses another open source project, <a href="http://sf.net/projects/sqlfairy"> SQLFairy</a>, to create a directed graph representation of SQL schema. It then uses a combination of Template Toolkit template files and the SQLFairy output to create an autogenerated website based on the underlying schema. This process is generic for any database and the resulting website is highly customizable through CSS and overriding layout templates.  The GMOD project is currently using Turnkey to display model organism genome databases.<br />
        An example (displays best in mozilla) site can be found <a href="http://monkey.wooly.org/db/Feature/419602?skin=gmod_web"> here</a> or <a href="http://monkey.wooly.org/db/Feature/419602?skin=ensembl"> here </a> for a different skin.  
<br />
<br />
The data being displayed is the latest GMOD database with the human 
genome loaded. Currently, the CSS based skins have only been tested on 
Mozilla, so if it looks horrible in IE I apologize.  My next priority is 
to ensure general cross-browser compatibility.

      <p align="left" class="title">Title: BioGraphNet, a distributed forum for heterogeneous biological networks.</p>
      <p align="left" class="blogbody">Biological network information is increasingly abundant.  The combination 
of biological networks may be viewed as a multicolor graph, with each color 
representing a different gene-gene or protein-protein relationship, e.g., 
protein interaction, sequence homology, correlated expression, 
transcriptional regulation, genetic interaction (sensu synthetic 
lethality), or metabolic relationship.  Relationship types may be further 
stratified by type of evidence supporting the relationship, by 
directionality or by confidence measure.  Furthermore, each organism has 
its own collection of networks.  Although this information's complexity 
argues for its maintenance by distributed groups, much of its value is 
derived through network integration.
<br />
<br />
BioMOBY has established a 'playground' for distributed services.  We have 
developed a 'sandbox' within BioMOBY called BioGraphNet.  BioGraphNet is a 
common standard and collection of services for sharing distributed network 
information.  We now serve several network data types, and encourage others 
to participate, using the common standard objects we have registered in 
BioMOBY's ontology.
<br />
<br />
As an example application illustrating the use of BioGraphNet, we provide 
BioTrawler, a web-based biological network browser that dynamically 
discovers suitable distributed data sources within BioGraphNet, integrates 
those selected by the end-user 'just in time', and visualizes the graph 
neighboring a user-defined set of genes. Graph layout is handled by the 
open-source GraphViz package (modified to handle multiple edges between a 
pair of nodes). BioTrawler also exports graph representations in several 
commonly used formats (GIF by default, but also Pajek, Cytoscape, and PDF).
<br />
<br />
The combination of BioMOBY and BioGraphNet represents a distributed network 
annotation system analogous to the Distributed Annotation System (DAS) for 
sharing genome annotation.
<br />
<br />
LICENSING:
The object descriptions and service interfaces are already available to all 
BioMOBY users. We plan to release BioTrawler under the Artistic License.

      <p align="left" class="title">Title: A Multiplatform Scientific Computing Environment</p>
      <p align="left" class="blogbody">Bioinformatics is one of the fastest growing disciplines within
     biology and computer science, and a proliferation of valuable
     software is one of the most obvious results.  In order to track
     these developments, scientists are increasingly forced to manage
     large and complex systems of application software, almost always
     in ad hoc and platform specific ways.  A system that can readily
     manage the complex dependencies among software packages and can
     ease the burden of installation and management is sorely needed.
     Ideally, such a system would operate on a diversity of computing
     platforms.  This paper describes our integration of a variety of
     bioinformatics software tools and scientific computing
     applications into a common management environment.  Notably, the
     system is useable on at least 18 distinct operating system /
     platform combinations.  As a result, scientists are able to
     easily install and manage a huge and diverse, yet wholly
     integrated, array of software, while simultaneously retaining
     flexibility in the choice of primary computing environment.  Our
     work with integrating approximately 100 major software packages
     covering traditional bioinformatics (e.g., sequence analysis and
     phylogenetic inference) computational biology broadly defined
     (e.g., spatial modeling), and other scientifically useful
     capabilities (e.g, teleconferencing) indicates that the effort
     required is relatively little and greatly eases the burden of
     creating scientific computing platforms.
<br />

Our work will ultimately be distributed from <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/software/packages.html"> here</a>; currently, some of it is only available from <a href="http://pkgsrc-wip.sourceforge.net/"> here</a> and more will be deposited there shortly.

      <p align="left" class="title">Title: caBIOperl: A new Perl API to the NCI's biomedical domain object middleware</p>
      <p align="left" class="blogbody">A reality of the bioinformatics community, and one of its strengths, is its 
diversity, including the range of programming languages that are utilized. However, this poses an accessibility problem 
for federated web-based resources, unless the APIs and databases can be readily accessed by diverse software development
languages. The U.S. National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) addresses this issue by providing a 
diversified set of open-source application programming interfaces to its caCORE system. These interfaces, part of the 
object-oriented middleware component known as caBIO, allow developers to write caCORE-powered applications using their 
choice of a native Java API, a SOAP-XML API, or even a simple HTTP-XML interface.
<br />
<br />
Each of these APIs delivers the same data and conforms to the same domain object model.
<br />
<br />
Since caBIO was first released, Perl programmers have found it rather inconvenient to access the caCORE system because
(1) they have to package their search criteria in SOAP or HTTP format and send the request to the caCORE server via 
the respective protocol; and (2) they have to parse the returned XML to extract the information they need. This has 
proven burdensome. For this reason we undertook the development of a new Perl API, recently released and named caBIOperl.
<br />
<br />
The caBIOperl is completely object-oriented. It provides an abstraction layer from SOAP and XML, so that Java programmers 
will be working with caBIO objects, similar to what a Java programmer experiences with the native caBIO Java API.
<br />
<br />
caBIOperl wraps the lower-level SOAP and DOM packages, and thus shields the developer from needing to understand SOAP 
or parse the XML. The first public release came out in April, 2004, and provides query access to 32 caBIO objects, 
including ClinicalTrialProtocol, Pathway, and Gene.
<br />
<br />
caBIOperl thus provides native Perl access that allows developers to customize queries according to the specialized needs 
of their local investigative teams. caBIOperl modules can be downloaded from the caBIO section of the <a href="http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/download">NCICB download site</a>.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">The Genomics Unified Schema (GUS) is a functional genomics 
infrastructure system in use at about 20 projects across approximately a 
dozen institutions.  GUS was developed at the Computational Biology and 
Informatics Lab (CBIL) as the infrastructure for <a 
href="http://plasmodb.org/">PlasmoDB</a> , <a 
href="http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/EPConDB/">EPConDB</a> and <a 
href="http://www.allgenes.org/">AllGenes</a>.  Over the last year we 
have packaged GUS for distribution and moved its development to open 
source which has resulted in an active user and development community. 
<br />
<br />
GUS includes a relational schema with more than 400 tables and views 
covering approximately 50 functional genomics concepts.  The schema is 
organized into five name spaces.  DoTS covers the central dogma (genes, 
RNAs, proteins); sequence and features; reagents, including clones, 
mapping and gene traps.  RAD covers microarray experiments in a 
MIAME-compliant representation.  TESS covers transcription region 
regulation; SRes covers controlled vocabularies, including about a dozen 
standards-based vocabularies and ontologies.  Finally, Core covers 
non-biological concepts used to track users and data. 
<br />
<br />
Upcoming schema expansion includes additional technologies (2-D gel and 
mass spectrometry, in situ hybridizations) that will make use of common 
experimental design and sample tables currently residing in the RAD 
schema.  We plan to work with emerging standards efforts for these 
domains paralleling our involvement in the MGED effort for microarray 
experiment information.
<br />
<br />
GUS also provides an application framework that includes a Perl and Java 
object-relational layer; a Data Load API; many "plugins" to load 
standard data sources; a Pipeline API to specify analysis protocols; and 
a Web Development Kit (WDK).  The WDK assists in the development of 
data-mining oriented websites such as <a 
href="http://plasmodb.org/">PlasmoDB</a>.  It provides a servlet 
framework, a declarative format to specify queries, results and records, 
page layout, many sample queries and query result caching.  The next 
generation WDK is under development in collaboration with the <a 
href="http://www.genedb.org">GeneDB</a> project at the Pathogen 
Sequencing Unit of the Sanger Center, and uses a Struts and JSP based 
model-view-controller design.
<br />
<br />
GUS runs under Linux, Tomcat and Oracle.  PostgreSQL compatibility is 
near completion.  The source is freely available.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">MOBY is an open source project for achieving interoperability in bioinformatics. 
Research and development has proceeded along a dual-development track that consists of MOBY Services (with an emphasis on 
SOAP technologies in a web services model) and Semantic MOBY (with an emphasis on RDF/OWL-DL in a semantic web model).
Semantic MOBY is designed specifically to operate in a nebulous and ever-changing world. In Semantic MOBY we identified 
three problems that are hindering widely deployable, scalable interoperability, namely the: i) fatal mutability of 
traditional interfaces (if a provider changes its interface, client code depending on that interface fails en masse); 
ii) rigidity and fragility of static classification schemes (changing the properties of a class near the root
of an inheritance hierarchy simultaneously affects the entire sub-tree); and iii) confounding structure and content 
(content is entangled with the presentation layer and/or implicit behaviors of the presentation software).
<br />
<br />
Addressing these problems essentially recasts the problem of interoperability from being one of simply specifying a 
syntax and messaging layer for syntactically connecting clients and providers via information in a registry look-up, to 
being one of providing clients and providers a way to semantically describe their data and identify data relevant to 
them. Our measure of success is to build an architecture that delivers: i) a common syntax; ii) a shared semantic and 
mechanism for semantic negotiation; iii) a discovery mechanism.  This talk presents the Semantic MOBY architecture and 
API and shows how this is accomplished.

BioJava was first released over four years ago.  It is now an 
established project and is widely used and supported around the world.  
Significant improvements in the past year include the addition of a 
data model for 3D structure information, better database support, and 
improvements that make BioJava more powerful in a distributed computing 
environment.

      <p align="left" class="title">Title: Applying software validation techniques to Bioperl</p>
      <p align="left" class="blogbody">With computer software playing an increasingly pervasive role in
society, the risks associated with software failures have begun
receiving more attention. Infamous examples of such software failures
include the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter (a victim of a metric vs.
imperial unit conversion error) and the fatal overdoses administered by
the Therac-25 medical accelerator (caused by an integer overflow). Even
when not catastrophic, software failure can be extremely costly: the US
Commerce Department's National Institute of Science and Technology
(NIST) estimated in 2002 that poor-quality software costs US businesses
nearly $60 billion per year.
<br />
<br /> 
Concern about the costs and other risks of software failure has led to
increasing interest in 'software validation'. The US FDA defines
software validation as "confirmation by examination and provision of
objective evidence that software specifications conform to user needs
and intended uses, and that the particular requirements implemented
through software can be consistently fulfilled." In the commercial
world, this process of examination and evidence gathering tends to be
specified by formal procedures (e.g., TQM and ISO 9001) applied in the
context of formal software development methodologies.
<br />
<br /> 
In the open source world, collaborative development makes formal
procedures hard to apply. Instead, open source projects rely on "many
eyes mak[ing] all bugs shallow" (Eric S. Raymond). Unfortunately,
however, in a large project like Bioperl, not all components are used
equally frequently, and thus not every component is examined equally
thoroughly or often.
<br />
<br /> 
In order to remedy these shortcomings of the open source development
process, a systematic approach is needed. The existing code, tests and
documentation must be examined from the point of view of validation,
allowing us to bridge the gap between cooperative development (open
source), and the more formal, contractual space of commercial
development.
<br />
<br /> 
We have established a validation process and applied it to Bioperl.  The
resulting validation framework has been developed in such a way that it
can be applied readily to other open source projects (e.g. Biojava).
The validation process, including documentation, Bioperl code changes
and novel test code developed will be described, as well as the overall
quality, reliability and usability improvements that result.  We aim to

LICENSING:

The Bioperl project addressed in the talk is licensed under the Perl
Artistic License, an accepted open source license according to the Open
Source Initiative.  The work performed by Electric Genetics, as
described in the talk, results in two outcomes:<br />
  1) ongoing contributions to the Bioperl suite, including improved
error handling, bug fixes and code additions.  These all fall under the
Perl Artistic License and will form significant contributions to the
open source project.<br />
  2) commercial documentation and validation suite, offered to clients
as a commercial product.  The documentation will be provided to paying
clients on a commercial basis and, thus, will not be immediately placed
in the Bioperl repository.  The validation suite will be retained by
Electric Genetics and validation services offered to clients.  If a
client wishes to purchase the validation suite, it will be licensed
using a commercial license.<br />
<br />
<br />
The business and licensing model we describe is similar to that of e.g.
Novell, who offer both commercial products (e.g. the Linux admin product
Red Carpet) as well as ongoing contributions to open source projects.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">Metabolic modelling efforts to date have primarily been concentrated on
relatively small (~10s of reactions) systems. The increasing
availability of annotated genomes and related data, means that the
poential exists to reconstruct the metabolism of a particular organism 
directly from such sources. My talk will introduce some of the
principles of metabolic modelling and our experiences in integrating
such techniques. The modelling software we use is developed in house - ScrumPy, 
metabolic modelling in Python, and available under GPL. The
bioinformatics components are still under development and not yet
publicly available (but might be by the time of the conference).

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">Many bioinformatics projects have very similar needs - they need a
relational DB to store information, they need annotation facilities to
add meta data to the data, they need a data transmission format, and
they need a programming interface to query the DB. We have explored
the use of Model Compilers to automatically build project SF directly
from Object Models - either using the universal modelling language
(UML) for the MAGEstk project or using custom XML-based models for the
Genex project.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">OpenOffice.org (OO.o) is a powerful Open Source office environment
that includes a spreadsheet application that provides multiple
scripting languages (currently StarBasic, Perl, and Python are
supported - the R language is supported via a bridge from either Perl
or Python) as well as Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). Using these,
the genex project has begun using OO.o as an analysis front end to our
microarray gene expression DB by directly querying the data from OO.o,
loading the query results into a spreadsheet, and running R-based data
processing and analysis tools, and then saving the results back to the
DB.
<br />
<br />
We believe this approach will be widely applicable to many other
informatics projects.

      <p align="left" class="title">Title: Model Centric Architecture</p>
      <p align="left" class="blogbody">As bioinformatics matures, the nature of bioinformatics software
development projects is changing. Existing projects and new efforts are
choosing to employ software engineering principles in lieu of ad hoc
development. These software engineering principles are being employed
because they represent best practices for creating reliable, stable, and
maintainable software. A significant aspect of the application of these
software engineering principles is the creation of models that describe
the domain of the software project.
<br />
<br />
Models carry numerous benefits to the software development and
maintenance lifecycle. Models communicate system behaviour, they allow
developers and maintainers to visualize and control the architecture of
a software system, they provide clear and effective artifactual
representation of the software system and domain, and they provide the
ability to develop software components that mimic elements of the
problem domain. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the most widely
accepted language for expressing object-oriented analysis and design
decisions.
<br />
<br />
A system is described in which the design of models that accurately
describe the bioinformatics domain plays a central role in the complete
life-cycle of the software engineering process. Given a set of models,
this system generates software components that are designed to be
interoperable in a web services framework regardless of the languages
used to provide or consume the service.
<br />
<br />
An example is provided in which Bioperl objects are passed to a Java
client.  This Java client deserializes the Bioperl objects and displays
the payload.
<br />
<br />
A second example is provided demonstrating a software application
implemented in Java Swing in which a large, complex object is passed to
and from a web service implemented in Perl using Bioperl.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">The <a href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk">VEGA database</a> presents high quality manual annotation of finished vertebrate 
genomes. Until recently the finished clones that constitute the tiling path of the chromosome were annotated individually. Tags in the data objects that represented parts of RNA transcripts that span several clones were used to describe how 
they should be fused. Fusing occurred during a conversion process that created an Ensembl database containing the 
complete gene structures.
<br />
<br />
The otter project was developed in order to present the annotator with a view of a contiguous region of a chromosome made 
from several clones, and to avoid the conversion step by storing the annotation directly in an Ensembl database.
<br />
<br />
The gene annotation data is passed between the annotation client and Ensembl database server in an XML format. The XML 
contains the clone assembly information along with the gene structure data. It is hoped that the XML format will be 
adopted as an exchange format by other centers who wish to display their annotation in VEGA.
<br />
<br />
The otter schema is an extension of the Ensembl database SQL schema. Additional tables store textual information about 
transcripts, genes and clones added by the annotator, implement a clone level locking mechanism, and keep track of the 
authors of particular annotations. These are accompanied by corresponding additions to the Ensembl Perl API. A 
lightweight HTTP server written in perl, otter_srv, exchanges XML with the client and saves the annotator's changes 
to the MySQL otter database in a single transaction.
<br />
<br />
The annotators' graphical interface, otterlace, now incorporates a number of improvements, such as the display 
of gapped alignments of sequence database hits to the genomic sequence.
<br />
<br />
The core otter software is available, under the same licence as <a href="http:// www.ensembl.org/code_licence.html">Ensembl</a>, by anonymous CVS (package ensemblotter) from cvs.sanger.ac.uk, where it will be joined by the otterlace client 
software. It is anticipated that a packaged distribution will also be created. The code is already in use by 
some of our collaborators outside the Sanger Institute.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">The NCBI is the host and developer of the world's largest bioinformatics projects. 
As such, it has developed an extensive, powerful, documented and freely available bioinformatics programming platform 
that contains a rich and robust set of functionalities designed to handle the intrinsic complexities of biology.  
The NCBI C++ toolkit provides portable application framework classes for argument processing, diagnostics, exceptions, 
connection streams, stream wrappers and threads.  The C++ code generator tool transforms ASN.1 data specifications 
into ready-to-use, error-free set of C++ classes and functions to liberate the programmer from writing class variable 
methods while providing garbage collection and object serialization to ASN.1/XML.  An object manager facilitates 
heterogeneous access to biological sequence data for annotation and display.  Moreover, the toolkit offers excellent 
support for database independent projects and complex CGI applications.  This talk will provide a high-level overview 
of the features and tools available in the NCBI C++ toolkit that enable computational investigations in biology 
by third-party developers.

      <p align="left" class="title">Title: MAGIC Tools: A Suite of Programs to Aid in Gene Discovery and Expression Analysis via EST/Genome Sequencing and Microarray Analysis</p>
      <p align="left" class="blogbody">The rapidly increasing rate at which biological data is being produced requires a concomitant development of relational 
databases and associated tools that can help laboratories contend with that data.  With this need in mind, we describe 
here a Modular Approach to a Genomic, Integrated, and Comprehensive (MAGIC) Database, and to associated Analysis and 
Visualization Tools. This Oracle 9i database derives from an initial focus in our laboratory on gene discovery via 
production and analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and subsequently on gene expression as assessed both by 
EST clustering and microarrays.
<br />
<br />
The Gene Discovery portion of the system focuses on information derived from DNA sequences. Aside from the Seq-LIMS 
and Admin portions to support wet-lab activities, administration, and sequence processing, this portion supports working 
with and viewing information about sequences and clones (Pipeline and SeqView), clustering via TGICL or via our novel 
algorithm Olympiad (Cluster), automatically annotating genes and clusters via BLAST or BLAT (Annotation), and discovering 
and classifying SNPs and microsatellites (Polymorphism).
<br />
<br />
The Microarray portion is a MIAME-compliant database with two components at present. These are Array-LIMS and 
Array-DataManager, which make possible remote entry of all information into the database, and Array-Analysis, which 
provides data mining and visualization. Spot calling and normalization are done externally through modular libraries, 
allowing other tools to be used as preferred. Data are visualized through Spotfire and Spotfire server, though again 
other tools may be used. Data in Spotfire server are linked real-time to MAGIC Database to provide on-demand information 
about interesting data points. 
<br />
<br />
Finally, because all aspects of interaction with the MAGIC Database are via a web browser, it is ideally suited not only 
for individual research laboratories, but also for core facilities that serve clients at any distance. 
<br />
<br />
We plan for MAGIC to be an Open Source project before the end of this calendar year. Releases will be made either via 
SourceForge or Bioinformatics.Org. Please see <a href="http://fungen.org">http://fungen.org</a> for more details.

      <p align="left" class="title">Title: BIAS: Bioinformatics Integrated Application Software</p>
      <p align="left" class="blogbody">We introduce a Java open source development platform entitled Bias 
(Bioinformatics Integrated Application Software) especially tailored to
Bioinformatics research and software development.
<br />
<br />
Bias aims to provide a rich toolkit  for carrying out integrative 
research addressing issues of data warehousing, data inter-operability
and the use of probabilistic learning
strategies such as Bayesian networks. It allows third-party tools to be
easily incorporated within the system, and it supports standards and
data-exchange protocols common to Bioinformatics including, for example,
the MIAME standard for gene expression data, R, and BioJava. 
<br />
<br />
Bias is built upon an object-relational strategy thus allowing for all
of the positive aspects of both relational database systems and
object-oriented languages. In particular it allows for a consistent data
model that can be easily extended to include new objects and relations
in an automatic way.
<br />
<br />
The main project website can be reached at <a href="http://www.mcb.mcgill.ca/~bias/">http://www.mcb.mcgill.ca/~bias/</a> with username: biasweb, password: TheBIASpassword. It will be available to the public shortly.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">The HUPO PSI protein interaction work group has jointly developed an XML 
standard for the representation of protein interaction data, the PSI MI 
format. PSI MI data is now available from major interaction data 
providers, including DIP, MINT, and IntAct. Based on the PSI MI 
standard, database and analysis tools from different providers can be 
joined to efficiently analyse and manipulate protein interaction data. 
We will present the IntAct, an open source protein interaction database 
and analysis tool which provides extensive PSI MI support. The web 
interface provides both textual and graphical representations of protein 
interactions, and allows exploring interaction networks in the context 
of the GO annotations of the interacting proteins. IntAct is Java-based, 
with Jakarta OJB object-relational mapping to Postgres or Oracle. PSI MI 
upload and download are possible as well as dynamic access to 
interaction networks by a web service or search URL. The direct URL 
access allows to directly access and further analyse PSI MI data in the 
open source tools ProViz and Cytoscape. These, in turn, provide a choice 
of fast network visualisation algorithms, integration with expression 
data, path finding and clustering in interaction networks.

      <p align="left" class="blogbody">Systems Biology can be defined as the use of skills in mathematics and computer 
science to integrate disparate sets of data to produce greater understanding of biological systems, and is a key 
component of predictive biology.  Scientific organisations need reliable and scalable informatics solutions to 
enable research into systems biology.  Here we present how freely available open source projects and software can be 
integrated to produce a sophisticated bioinformatics platform, where microarray data and genomic sequence can be 
integrated with functional annotation and predictive tools to identify groups of co-regulated genes and biological 
pathways in host-pathogen interaction systems.
