The Open Source Authors' Contract
Steven Brenner, University of California, Berkeley.

Most universities, national laboratories, companies, and other employers
have clauses in their employment contracts that prevent or restrict the
creation and use of open source software.  Indeed, it seems likely that
much of the biological open source software is being produced illegally,
in violation of institutions' terms.  While benign neglect of enforcement
of the institutions' regulations has led to a situation that is generally
acceptable, it is not ideal.

Several individuals have sought the ability to produce open source
software by seeking exemptions or variations of their institutions'
intellectual property agreements.  However, this is a painstaking process,
and the associated legal fees can be costly.  I propose that a general
contract be drawn up, which has standard terms for individuals to create
open source software without undue constraints.

Since this idea was first broached a year ago, there has been widespread
discussion regarding regulations governing production open source
software.  This talk will provide a background to the motivation for the
Authors' contract, as well as recent responses which suggest productive
ways forward.
