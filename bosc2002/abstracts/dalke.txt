                     Usability

Open source software is often said to be "unusable."  On the surface
this doesn't make sense because many of the projects are widely used
to do real work.  But usability isn't a binary value, it refers to
ease of use.  Two packages can be equally featureful but one be much
more usable than the other.

A lot of research has gone into understanding how to make more usable
software.  This knowledge is starting to make its way into mainstream
software projects, but is still relatively unused in bioinformatics.
I'll discuss several reasons why this might be so, the major one being
that few even know this topic exists.

In my talk I'll cover some of the standard techniques of usability
design, including testing, persona development, use cases, and paper
prototyping.  These are simple, inexpensive techniques that can be
applied to almost any project to make them more usable and enjoyable.
To keep my presentation grounded, I'll include examples from my
experiences in applying them to real projects.
