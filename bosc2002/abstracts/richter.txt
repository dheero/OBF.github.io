GOET: the General Ontology Editing Tool

Abstract:

GOET is a Java application designed to facilitate the creation of
ontology schemas and data. GOET allows a user to define DAML+OIL-like
schemas and then populate those schemas with data. Data can loaded from
and saved to DAML+OIL flat files, as well as numerous other formats.

GOET is highly customizable via pluggable editor kits. Editor kits are
Java jar files that define a custom user interface for GOET, tailored to a
particular kind of data. Editor kits allow programmers to create the most
efficient user interface for any given ontology. GOET comes with a generic
editor kit that can edit *any* ontology, making it easy for users to
experiment with new schemas.

GOET provides a strong toolkit for ontology editing, with automatic
support for history tracking, undo/redo, cycle checking, and other
important graph editing tools. This toolkit makes it easy for programmers
to develop new, powerful editor kits.
