The MAGE software toolike (MAGEstk) project has created a software
infrastructure we believe will be useful to many biologists. It was
originally created to provide a complete software API to the
MicroArray Gene Expression Object Model (MAGE-OM) developed by the OMG
(omg.org) in collaboration with MGED (mged.org). Since it's inception,
MAGEstk has evolved into a powerful generic tool for automatically
generating a broad informatics infrastructure from a UML object model.

When provided with a UML data model the MAGEstk tools are able to
automatically generate the following:

* a software API in Java, Perl, C++, and (soon) Python
* an XML markup language to transmit data, defined by a DTD
* software for serialization of data objects to XML, and
  de-serializaiton of XML into data objects
* a relation DB schema in SQL to store the data objects persistently
* (soon) the code for serializing objects to the DB and de-serializing
  data from the DB into objects

By providing such a useful set of infrastructure so easily, many
informatics projects will be able to get started quickly without
getting bogged down re-implementing basic infrastructure. Since it
requires a UML data model, this forces biologists to spend time
developing a good model for the data, and not on software
development. This should help improve the overall quality of the final
system. We believe that MAGEstk will prove itself especially useful
for enabling informatics projects to communicate data using emerging
WWW services protocols such as MOBY.
