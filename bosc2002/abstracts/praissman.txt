Rapid progress of genome sequencing projects and the NIH protein structure
initiative has brought about an increased focus on biological data
integration and computationally guided experimentation. As part of the
effort to develop high throughput structure determination technologies, it
is crucial to integrate and perform large scale analysis of
interdisciplinary data. While many tools exist for parsing biological
databases and interfacing with existing analysis programs, there is
currently a lack of support infrastructure for correlating biological
information from disparate sources. Our toolkit is an attempt to address
this need using mathematical set and combinatorial graph techniques.
 
The toolkit, which is implemented in perl and uses some bioperl modules, has
already been applied in analyzing neighbour gene relateness for complete
bacterial genomes released at NCBI. It will be extended to support further
correlation of genes with other genomic, structural and functional information.

Current features:

  * calculating basic genome statistics
  * calculating statistics for genes grouped by intergenic distance
  * parsing and classifying functional annotation
  * analyzing annotation within sets of genes grouped by intergenic distance
  * generating user specified sequence fragments
 
Planned features:

  * subset generating operations on gene sets using user supplied functions
  * generic filtering iterators
  * combinatorial data structures for further correlating biological information
