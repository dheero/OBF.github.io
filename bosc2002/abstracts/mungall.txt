Chris Mungall:  BioSQL

The BioSQL project defines a general bioinformatics schema intended for
use in multiple projects across different database management systems and
programming languages. Adapters exist for perl, java, python and ruby.
These adapters provide an API for accessing a BioSQL database via that
languages bio-project object model. The BioSQL schema and adapter code
works with both MySQL and postgres, and should be easily adaptable to
other DBMSs e.g. Oracle.

BioSQL takes a modular approach to schemas. The existing core modules deal
primarily with sequence annotation data. There is also a module for
controlled vocabularies and ontologies, and modules can be added for
dealing with other data classes, eg expression data.

The BioSQL schema is designed to be extensible, individual projects can
extend the datamodel via controlled property tables, whilst still
conforming to the core schema.
