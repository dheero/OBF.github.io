Title: GHMM & HMMed: A comprehensive HMM toolkit

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are one of the most successfull tools 
for analyzing biological sequences. 

We have developed a graphical editor for HMMs called HMMEd which 
allows to create sophisticated models manually using a graphical 
user interface. Hierarchical models are supported (e.g. a three 
state model representating a single codon as one 'super state'), 
as well as a wide range of HMM extensions and user data associated 
with the states of the HMM. Graphical editors for discrete 
emission distributions as well as mixtures of continous pdfs 
are integrated. 

For the exchange of HMMs we propose a XML-based format which is 
loosely based on GraphML, is hierarchical and also incorporates 
necessary extensions for proper graphical display.

The GNU (pending permission from the FSF) HMM library (GHMM) is a 
C-library providing efficient implementations of a comprehensive 
collection of algorithms for both discrete and continous 
emission HMMs. Python bindings allow interactive work with HMMs 
from the Python command line and, at some later stage, tight 
integration with HMMEd, which is also written in Python using 
Tkinter.

HMMEd (pronounced Hammered) and the GHMM are licensed under the LGPL.
