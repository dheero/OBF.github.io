The Bioperl project recently released version 1.0 of our toolkit for life
science programming.  The components include modules which support for
sequences, sequence reading and writing, sequence features and annotations
and features with simple and complex locations, multiple sequence
alignments, phylogenetic trees, BLAST & FASTA parsing, building and
accessing local sequence databases, accessing remote sequence databases,
retrieving and manipulating bibliographic references, interoperating with
BioCORBA and OBDA biological object standards.  The toolkit has been used
in a wide array of situations from simple laboratory situations and as the
building blocks for enterprise solutions in EnsEMBL and the Generic Model
Organism Database (GMOD).

The toolkit is built with an easily extensible architecture which can be
used for quickly building perl programs to address specific research
questions.  Several examples of its use to answer real laboratory
questions will be discussed.
