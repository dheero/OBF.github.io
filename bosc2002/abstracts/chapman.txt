Biopython and the Laboratory Scientist

Brad Chapman, representing the Biopython Project

Biopython is a collection of open-source tools in the Python programming
language. Developed by a collection of programmers from around the world, the
Biopython toolkit is designed to provided re-usable code for anyone answering
biological questions using Python. Biopython has been around since 1999, and
has a number of active contributors and users. In this talk, I will briefly 
describe the basic components provided in the Biopython toolkit. From 
there, I will describe how Biopython can be used in a academic laboratory 
environment, taking examples from my own lab. The emphasis will be on 
utilization of Biopython code for automating everyday tasks faced by wet 
lab researchers. I will try to show that Python and Biopython can be used
productively by researchers lacking formal training in computer science. 
Finally, I will describe integrating Biopython into larger bioinformatics 
projects. Again, this will draw on my own experience using Biopython and 
will describe how using Biopython can help make your coding life easier 
when approaching a large project. The aim of the entire talk it to 
convince you that using open source libraries like Biopython is worth the time
invested in learning it.
