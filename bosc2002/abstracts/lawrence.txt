LumberJack is a ML heuristic search tool written in JAVA that
progressively jackknifes windows from a sequence alignment to generate
multiple neighbor joining trees.  It compares the trees statistically on
the basis of their relative likelihood scores.  This allows the program
not only to identify reasonable phylogenetic trees quickly, but also to
map phylogenetic signal onto the alignment.
