	The OmniGene project has produced modules to build web services
for data analysis, integration, and visualization. OmniGene accomplishes
this goal through the utilization of Java Enterprise and web service
technologies. The core API consists of modules to: 1) perform queries
across disparate databases, 2) Transform queries into commonly used XML
formats, 3) Parse the output of these queries into an object graph, 4)
Visualize and share knowledge in a client server or true peer to peer
network, 5) Dynamically discover another web service, 6) Easily plug in
analysis applications. One majorgoal of the OmniGene development team is
to abstract away XML parsing, Enterprise Java Bean, and trasaction code
from the bioinformatician so that they may concentrate on their data and
data analysis.

	The OmniGene system will utilize the output and API from the
BioMOBY project to perform dynamic discovery of services. The BioMOBY and
OmniGene developers are now working together to integrate their two
projects. OmniGene is an open source, open standards initiative and is
distributed under the BSD license.
