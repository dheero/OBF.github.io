Electric Genetics and SANBI have developed a tool that integrates transcript
information, genomic sequence, genetic mapping information and a standardised
controlled vocabulary to serve as the basis for a more complex system that
will aid in the identification of disease genes candidates.

A controlled vocabulary which consists of a predefined orthogonal set of
hierarchical schemas was constructed.  These currently include schemas
containing terms describing anatomical site, cell type, developmental stage
and pathology.

Expression data was mapped to the vocabulary by associating 6937 individual
cDNA libraries (including dbEST and SAGE) with one or more terms in as many
of these schemas as possible.

The vocabulary was implemented as a relational database schema.  A Python API
was constructed to provide a number of facilities to mine the vocabulary
database, including a parser for a simple boolean query language.

The controlled vocabulary demonstrates that mapping expressed sequences to
terms in a number of separate hierarchical schemas allows detailed mining of
gene expression state information.

Current ongoing work includes the investigation of the utility of DAS v1.5 to
serve as a query front-end for the controlled vocabulary.
