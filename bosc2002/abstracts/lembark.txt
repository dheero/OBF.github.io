One of the more challanging areas of BioInformatics is simply getting
computer work organized. The challange is complicated by competing
requirements for speed, orginazation and dynamic schedules. Most existing
tools are ill-suited for a dynamic parallel sheduling of interactive
jobs. Traditional tools such as cron are generally too static, make sytax
for handling dynamic job lists is byzantine at best, and the
commercial packages are frequently too complicated to handle dynamic
schedules easily.

Schedule::Depend is a OO Perl module designed for specifically this kind
of task. It uses a simple syntax of colon-separated dependencies (pretty
much like make's) with the individual job tags being passed through an
"unalis" method. The default method provided can handle object or class
methods, subroutine refernces or perl blocks along with shell paths. This
avoids having to wrap everyting in shell code, and simplifies the syntax
enormously. The simplified syntax makes generating dynamic schedules far
simpler than with other tools. The module provides for job tracking,
restarting (i.e., skipping previously completed tasks) and continuing after
an aborted job (much like "make -k").

As an example I'd bring in a working schedule used in a BioInfo. lab
or schedule from update_wormbase.

The module itself is on CPAN, released under the same terms as
Perl5.
