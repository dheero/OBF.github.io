Bioperl-Pipeline System

The prominence of the in-silico laboratory coupled with the explosion of
comparative genomics have made the nature of computational biological
analysis increasingly complex. This is exacerbated by the plethora of
software that are now available. It is not uncommon for an analysis to
involve large amounts of data from disparate sources and formats,
different programs with specific requirements and output formats that must
be suitable for human interpretation. There thus exists a need for a
flexible workflow framework that will hide such complexity, allowing
scientists to focus on their analysis, while providing bioinformaticians a
coherent methodology for which to extend the system. It was with this in
mind that we developed the bioperl-pipeline system. Largely adapted from
the Ensembl Pipeline Annotation System, some of the features in the
current system include:

  1)  Handling of various input and output data formats from various databases.

  2)  A bioperl interface to non-specific loadsharing software (LSF,PBS
etc) to ensure that the various analysis programs are run in proper
order and are successfully completed while re-running those that fail.

  3)  A flexible pluggable bioperl interface that allows programs to be
      'pipeline-enabled'.

We are currently looking at extending the system in the following way:

  1)  A 'grid-aware' system that allows jobs to be distributed over a
      bio-cluster network harnassing collective computing power that will
      be especially useful for small groups looking to perform
      compute-intensive analysis.

  2)  A user-friendly click and drag GUI system to allow easy workflow
      design and job tracking.

We are now applying this framework to our compara system for high
throughput multi-species studies. We will discuss the design and
implementation details of the bioperl-pipeline package.
