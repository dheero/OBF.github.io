					<h2>Abstract Submission for BOSC 2002</h2>
We are soliciting abstracts to be considered for talks at BOSC 2002.  
BOSC is a
great opportunity for you to tell the community about your use,
development, or philosophy of open source software development in
bioinformatics.
We will select several submitted
abstracts for 20-minute talks and others for shorter "lightning" talks.  Accepted abstracts
will be published on the BOSC web site.
<P>
If you are interested in speaking or presenting a poster at BOSC 2002,
please send us:
<UL>
<LI> an abstract (no more than a few paragraphs);
<LI> a URL for the project page, if applicable;
<LI> information about the open
       source license used for your software or your release plans.
</UL>
					<p>
Please email your abstract to the BOSC committee <a href=mailto:bosc@open-bio.org>&lt;bosc@open-bio.org&gt;</a>
by April 30, 2002.  You will be notified on May 15, 2002, about whether your abstract
