	<p>We are developing E-CELL Simulation Environment with the aim of providing fundamental software platform for non-trivial, multi-scale modeling and simulation of cell systems. E-CELL attempts to provide a framework not only for analyzing metabolism and cell signaling, but also for higher-order cellular phenomena such as gene regulation networks, DNA replication, and other occurrences in the cell cycle.</p>
	<p>The current version at this point in time of writing this is 1.0beta. Based on 1.0 series, we are developing a new version, 2.x series, for increased portability and robustness. After extensive redesign of simulation engine and simulator architecture, version 3.x will be developed.</p>
	<p>The core portion of the simulation environment, E-CELL Core System (ECS) is a object oriented software written in C++. Other software modules are written in python, C++ and perl. Python language interpreter will be integrated with ECS in version 3.x.</p>
	<p>We plan to eventually make them free &quot;open source&quot; software. We are now calling for developers and collaborators.</td>
